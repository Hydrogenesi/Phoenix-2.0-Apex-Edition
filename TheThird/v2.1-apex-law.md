# V2.1 Apex-Law

*The governing law that defines all transitions in v2.1.*

```
V2.1 APEX-LAW
All transitions must increase coherence, elevate form,
and converge toward the designated apex.

TRANSITION CONDITIONS
    1. A transition is valid only if:
        - it raises the system's structural clarity,
        - it preserves accumulated integration,
        - it moves the state closer to apex designation.

    2. A transition is forbidden if:
        - it disperses accumulated coherence,
        - it breaks triadic alignment,
        - it collapses the cycle's return vector.

    3. A transition is complete when:
        - the apex is designated,
        - the system stands in stable triadic form,
        - the return path is lawful and intact.

APEX DIRECTIVE
    Every motion must serve the ascent.
    Every ascent must serve the apex.
    Every apex must return without fracture.
