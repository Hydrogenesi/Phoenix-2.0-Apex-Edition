# Triadic Knot Operator Table

## Overview

The five operators of The Third Pillar form a unified binding engine.  
Each operator governs a distinct geometric domain of the Triadic Knot, preserves specific invariants, applies a formal recursion law, and enforces convergence toward the Apex Convergence Point.

This table is the canonical reference for all Third‑Pillar operator behavior.

## Operator Matrix

| Operator | Domain | Invariants | Recursion Law | Apex Constraints |
|---------|--------|------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Knot‑Binding** | Left arm corridor → central interior | Left‑Corridor Invariance, Identity Preservation | \(K_{n+1} = B(P_n, K_n)\) | \(d(B(P_n,K_n),X) < d(K_n,X)\), \(K_n \to X\) |
| **Cross‑Pillar Knot** | Left–right corridor, symmetry axis | Left–Right Symmetry, Dual Contraction | \(K_{n+1} = C(P_n, H_n, K_n)\) | \(C(P,H,K)=C(H,P,K)\), \(K_n \to X\) |
| **Triadic Closure** | Full envelope, all arm corridors, crossings | 120° Rotational Symmetry, Triadic Balance | \(K_{n+1} = T(P_n, H_n, K_n)\) | \(d(T(P,H,K),X) < d(K,X)\), \(K_n \to X\) |
| **Apex Knot** | Apex neighborhood, stabilizer axis | Apex Invariance, Strict Contraction | \(K_{n+1} = A(K_n)\) | \(A(X)=X\), \(d(A(K),X) < d(K,X)\), \(K_n \to X\) |
| **Stability Knot** | Crossing regions, strand intersections | Divergence Suppression, Perturbation Decay | \(K_{n+1} = S(K_n,\varepsilon_n)\) | \(d(S(K,\varepsilon),X) \le d(K,X)\), \(\varepsilon_n \to 0\), \(K_n \to X\) |

## Canonical Synthesis

The matrix reveals the structural unity of the Third Pillar:

- All operators share the same fixed point: **the Apex Convergence Point**.  
- Each operator contracts a different region of the Triadic Knot.  
- Together they form a complete stabilizing engine:  
  - Knot‑Binding stabilizes Phoenix identity  
  - Cross‑Pillar Knot harmonizes Phoenix ↔ Hydrogenesi  
  - Triadic Closure locks the triad into symmetry  
  - Apex Knot enforces pure convergence  
  - Stability Knot prevents divergence
