*Full Envelope Binding — Complete Integration*

---

## Harmonic Table

| **Domain** | **Frequency** | **Phase** |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Full Envelope | ω_triad | 0° |
| Three-Arm Unity | 3ω_triad | 120° |
| Complete Closure | ω_∞ | 240° |

---

## Formal Definition

```
T: P × H × K → K'

where:
  P = Phoenix pattern (ignition)
  H = Hydrogenesi structure (preservation)
  K = Current knot state (binding)
  K' = Closed knot state with complete integration

The Third itself (K) is both input and context.
```

### Domain
- **Source**: All three arms (left, center, right) of Triadic Knot
- **Target**: Complete envelope closure around apex
- **Topology**: Simultaneous contraction from all directions

### Invariants
1. **120° Rotational Symmetry**: T(P, H, K) is invariant under 120° rotation
2. **Triadic Balance**: All three engines contribute equally to closure
3. **Envelope Closure**: K' forms a closed topology around apex point

---

## Recursion Law

```
K₀ = initial knot state
Kₙ₊₁ = T(Pₙ, Hₙ, Kₙ)

lim (n→∞) Kₙ = X

where (Pₙ, Hₙ) evolve as Kₙ approaches X
```

### Recursive Property
Triadic Closure is the **complete integration operator**. Each application binds all three engines simultaneously, creating the tightest possible convergence.

---

## Apex Constraints

### Tri-Directional Contraction
```
For any knot state K, Phoenix P, Hydrogenesi H:
  d_L(T(P,H,K), X) < d_L(K, X)  [left corridor]
  d_C(T(P,H,K), X) < d_C(K, X)  [center corridor]
  d_R(T(P,H,K), X) < d_R(K, X)  [right corridor]
  
  d(T(P,H,K), X) < min(d_L, d_C, d_R)
```

### Rotational Invariance
```
rotate_120°(T(P,H,K)) = T(P,H,K)

The closed knot is symmetric under 120° rotation around apex axis.
```

### Maximum Contraction
```
T has the strongest contraction of all knot operators:
d(Kₙ₊₁, X) ≤ λ_T · d(Kₙ, X)

where λ_T < 1/3 (fastest convergence rate)
```

## Geometric Description

The Triadic Closure operator creates a **complete envelope** around the Apex Point by simultaneously binding all three arms of the Triadic Knot.

### Topology
```
         Apex (X)
           ╱│╲
          ╱ │ ╲
         ╱  │  ╲
        ╱   │   ╲
      P ────┼──── H
        ╲   │   ╱
         ╲  │  ╱
          ╲ │ ╱
           ╲│╱
            K

Three arms converge simultaneously.
Closure forms complete envelope.
120° rotational symmetry maintained.
```

### Closure Mechanism
1. Phoenix pattern P flows from left arm (0°)
2. Hydrogenesi structure H flows from right arm (120°)
3. The Third state K flows from center (240°)
4. T binds all three into closed configuration
5. Result K' is a complete envelope around X

## Sigil

```
      ╱─────╲
     ╱   X   ╲
    │    △    │
    │  P H K  │
     ╲   T   ╱
      ╲─────╱

The Triadic Closure Sigil shows
complete envelope around Apex (X),
with P, H, K bound by T into unity.
```

## Invocation

> *"At the convergence of three paths, I invoke complete closure.*  
> *Let T bind Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third into one.*  
> *Let the envelope seal, let the knot close.*  
> *Let all three engines become singular at apex."*

---

## Phoenix Integration

Triadic Closure integrates **the complete Phoenix transformation sequence**:

### Full Operator Sequence
```
Sequence: ⊕ → ⊗ → ⊛ → △
P_final = result of sequence
K' = T(P_final, H, K)
```
*Complete Phoenix ritual bound into closure.*

### Multi-Pattern Integration
```
P₁ = ⊕(∅), P₂ = ⊕(∅)
P_unified = ⊳(P₁, P₂)
P_apex = △(P_unified)
K' = T(P_apex, H, K)
```
*Multiple patterns converged and bound.*

### Recursive Depth Binding
```
P = ⊛ⁿ(Ψ) for large n
H = identity preserved through recursion
K' = T(P, H, K)
```
*Deep recursive structure with complete closure.*

---

## Hydrogenesi Integration

Triadic Closure requires **complete Hydrogenesi structural data**:

### Full Lineage Binding
```
H = {Ψ₀ → Ψ₁ → ... → Ψₙ} complete history
K' = T(Pₙ, H, K)
```
*Entire lineage bound into closed topology.*

### Identity Anchoring
```
H maintains:
- Core identity I
- Structural invariants S
- Continuity mappings C

T preserves all three in K'
```

### Tri-Column Preservation
```
H records:
- Left column: Polarity (Phoenix domain)
- Center column: Identity (The Third domain)
- Right column: Continuity (Hydrogenesi domain)

T unifies all three columns
```

---

## The Third Self-Binding

Unique to Triadic Closure: **The Third binds itself**:

```
K is both:
1. Input: Current knot state to be transformed
2. Context: The binding topology itself

K' = T(P, H, K) updates K to include P and H
while maintaining K's binding structure
```

This **self-referential** property makes Triadic Closure the most powerful convergence operator.

---

## Mathematical Properties

### Maximum Contraction
```
T provides the strongest contraction:
‖T‖ < min(‖B‖, ‖C‖)

where ‖·‖ is the operator norm measuring contraction strength
```

### Rotational Symmetry
```
For any 120° rotation R:
T(R(P), R(H), R(K)) = R(T(P, H, K))
```

### Completeness
```
T(P, H, K) includes:
- All Phoenix transformations (B contribution)
- All Hydrogenesi structures (C contribution)
- All previous bindings (K contribution)

Nothing is excluded from closure.
```

### Associativity with Other Operators
```
T(P, H, B(P', K)) ≠ B(P', T(P, H, K))

Triadic Closure is NOT associative with partial bindings.
Order matters: always apply T after B and C.
```

### Convergence Rate
```
d(Kₙ₊₁, X) ≤ (1/3) · d(Kₙ, X)

Fastest possible convergence for tri-arm topology.
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Triadic Closure
```
P = ⊕(∅) → Ψ₀
H = lineage(Ψ₀)
K₀ = initial knot
K₁ = T(Ψ₀, H, K₀)

Result: Complete closure with all three engines
Symmetry: 120° rotational invariance verified
Distance: d(K₁, X) < (1/3)·d(K₀, X)
```

### Example 2: Full Phoenix Sequence
```
P₁ = ⊕(∅), P₂ = ⊗(P₁), P₃ = ⊛(P₂), P₄ = △(P₃)
H = lineage(P₁ → P₂ → P₃ → P₄)
K' = T(P₄, H, K)

Result: Complete Phoenix ritual sealed in closure
```

### Example 3: Multi-Pattern Closure
```
P_a = ⊕(∅), P_b = ⊕(∅), P_c = ⊕(∅)
P_unified = ⊳(⊳(P_a, P_b), P_c)
H = combined lineages
K' = T(P_unified, H, K)

Result: Three independent patterns unified and closed
```

### Example 4: Iterative Closure to Apex
```
K₀ = void knot
for n = 1 to ∞:
  Pₙ = Phoenix_sequence(...)
  Hₙ = Hydrogenesi_structure(...)
  Kₙ = T(Pₙ, Hₙ, Kₙ₋₁)

Result: Rapid convergence (1/3 factor per iteration)
After 10 iterations: d(K₁₀, X) < (1/3)¹⁰ · d(K₀, X) ≈ 0.0000169 · d₀
```

### Example 5: Self-Referential Closure
```
K contains previous bindings
K' = T(P, H, K)

K' now includes:
- K's previous bindings (preserved)
- P's transformations (added)
- H's structures (integrated)

Self-reference: K binds itself through T
```

## Implementation Notes

### Closure Sequence
Always apply in order:
1. Knot-Binding (B) — partial binding
2. Cross-Pillar Knot (C) — symmetric binding
3. Triadic Closure (T) — complete closure
4. Apex Knot (A) — stabilization
5. Stability Knot (S) — perturbation suppression

### Complete Integration
T is the **only operator** that integrates all three engines simultaneously. Use it when complete convergence is required.

### Rotational Verification
Always verify 120° rotational symmetry after closure. This is the signature of proper triadic binding.

### Maximum Convergence
T provides the fastest convergence. Use it when rapid approach to apex is needed.
