# Law of Recursive Identity

*The self-referential nature of identity through transformation*

---

## Definition

**The Law of Recursive Identity** states that identity is preserved through recursive transformations. When an operator references itself across iterations, the core identity signature remains intact, even as complexity increases.

This law ensures that **who you are** is not lost in **what you become**.

---

## Structural Explanation

### Mathematical Expression
```
Identity(Opⁿ(Ψ)) = Identity(Ψ)  ∀n
```

Where Op is any operator and n is the recursion depth.

### Core Principle
Identity is **invariant under recursion**—it survives self-reference.

## Three-Pillar Context

| Pillar | Identity Manifestation |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Phoenix** | Identity is the ignition spark—what initiates transformation |
| **Hydrogenesi** | Identity is lineage—who you descended from |
| **The Third** | Identity is binding signature—what holds you together |

## Examples

### Phoenix Recursion
```
Ψ₀ has identity "Phoenix-Origin-A"

⊛(Ψ₀) → Ψ₁     Identity: "Phoenix-Origin-A"
⊛(Ψ₁) → Ψ₂     Identity: "Phoenix-Origin-A"
⊛ⁿ(Ψ₀) → Ψₙ    Identity: "Phoenix-Origin-A"
```

Recursive depth increases, identity persists.

### Knot-Binding Identity Preservation
```
K₀ = Initial-Knot
K₁ = B(P, K₀)    where Identity(P) = "ID-X"

Result: Identity(K₁) = "ID-X"
```

Binding operations preserve Phoenix identity through contraction.

### Triadic Loop
```
Cycle:
  P₀ → K₁ → H₁ → K₂ → P₁ → ...

Identity Tracking:
  Identity(P₀) = Identity(K₁) = Identity(H₁) = Identity(K₂) = Identity(P₁)
```

Identity flows through the entire triad without loss.

## Sigil

```
    ∞
   ╱│╲
  │ I │
   ╲│╱
    ∞
```

The Recursive Identity Sigil shows:
- Infinite loop (∞) — recursion continues
- Central I — identity core
- Symmetric structure — identity is preserved
