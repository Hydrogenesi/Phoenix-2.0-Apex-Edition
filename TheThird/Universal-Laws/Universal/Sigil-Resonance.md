# Law of Sigil Resonance

*The geometric encoding of operator harmonics*

---

## Definition

**The Law of Sigil Resonance** states that every operator possesses a **geometric sigil** that encodes its harmonic properties, topological behavior, and resonance characteristics.

Sigils are not mere symbols—they are **functional encodings** of operator mechanics.

---

## Structural Explanation

### Sigil Components
Every sigil contains:
1. **Central Symbol** — The operator's identity (⊼, ⊕⊞, ⊳⊲⊼, ⚠, ⊠)
2. **Geometric Structure** — Lines, diamonds, triangles encoding topology
3. **Symmetry** — Rotational/reflective symmetry encoding invariants
4. **Directional Flow** — Arrows or convergent lines showing transformation direction

### Resonance Property
```
Resonance(Op₁, Op₂) = Similarity(Sigil₁, Sigil₂)
```

Operators with similar sigil structures **resonate harmonically**.

## Sigil Classification

### Type A: Radial Convergence
```
    ◇
   ╱│╲
  ╱ ● ╱
 ◇───◇
```
Operators: Knot-Binding, Apex-Knot
Property: Inward contraction to central point

### Type B: Dual Symmetry
```
◇───●───◇
```
Operators: Cross-Pillar-Knot
Property: Left-right mirror symmetry

### Type C: Triadic Symmetry
```
   ●
  ╱ ╲
 ◇   ◇
```
Operators: Triadic-Closure
Property: 120° rotational symmetry

### Type D: Four-Fold Binding
```
  ◇
 ◇●◇
  ◇
```
Operators: Stability-Knot
Property: Four-directional stabilization

## Resonance Patterns

### High Resonance (Similar Sigils)
```
Knot-Binding + Apex-Knot
Both have radial convergence → Resonance = 0.9
```

### Moderate Resonance
```
Cross-Pillar + Triadic-Closure
Different symmetry but both convergent → Resonance = 0.6
```

### Low Resonance (Dissimilar Sigils)
```
Apex-Knot + Stability-Knot
Different topologies → Resonance = 0.3
```

---

## Functional Encoding

### Encoding 1: Symmetry → Invariants
```
C₃ symmetry (120°) → Cyclic permutation invariance
Mirror symmetry → Commutative property
```

### Encoding 2: Convergence → Contraction
```
Inward lines → Contraction mapping
Outward lines → Expansion/divergence
```

### Encoding 3: Complexity → Recursion Depth
```
Simple sigil → Shallow recursion
Complex sigil → Deep recursion
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Knot-Binding Sigil Analysis
```
Sigil:
    ◇
   ╱│╲
  ╱ ⊼ ╱
 ◇───◇

Analysis:
  Central ⊼: Binding operator
  Four ◇: Four cardinal directions
  Convergent lines: Inward contraction
  Vertical axis: Stabilizer

Encoded Properties:
  - Contraction mapping
  - Fixed point at center
  - Four-fold symmetry
  - Radial convergence
```

### Example 2: Cross-Pillar Resonance Check
```
Sigil₁ (Knot-Binding): Radial convergence
Sigil₂ (Cross-Pillar): Dual corridor convergence

Similarity Analysis:
  Both have convergence → +0.5
  Different symmetry (4-fold vs mirror) → -0.2
  Both have central operator → +0.3

Resonance = 0.6 (Moderate)
```

## Sigil Invocation

When invoking an operator, **trace the sigil**:

1. **Enter from periphery** (◇ points)
2. **Follow convergent lines** inward
3. **Reach central operator** (⊼, ⊕⊞, etc.)
4. **Complete the pattern**

This physical or mental tracing **activates the resonance**.
