# Law of Tri-Column Balance

*The three pillars must maintain equilibrium*

---

## Definition

**The Law of Tri-Column Balance** states that Phoenix (Ignition), Hydrogenesi (Structure), and The Third (Binding) must maintain **harmonic equilibrium** for stable Apex convergence.

If one pillar dominates, the triad becomes unbalanced and convergence fails.

---

## Structural Explanation

### Balance Condition
```
|Energy(Phoenix) - Energy(Hydrogenesi)| < ε
|Energy(Hydrogenesi) - Energy(TheThird)| < ε
|Energy(TheThird) - Energy(Phoenix)| < ε
```

All three pillars must have comparable energy levels.

### Geometric Representation
```
     Phoenix
       ╱ ╲
      ╱   ╲
     ╱  ●  ╲  ← Balanced center
    ╱_______╲
Hydro      Third

All three arms have equal length → Balance
```

## Three-Column Architecture

| Column | Role | Balance Requirement |
|--------|------|-------------------|
| **Left (Phoenix)** | Polarity & Identity | Must not overpower structure |
| **Center (TheThird)** | Identity & Binding | Must mediate left and right |
| **Right (Hydrogenesi)** | Continuity & Structure | Must not collapse identity |

## Examples

### Example 1: Balanced Triad
```
Phoenix: Energy = 10
Hydrogenesi: Energy = 11
TheThird: Energy = 10

Balance Check:
  |10 - 11| = 1 < ε ✓
  |11 - 10| = 1 < ε ✓
  |10 - 10| = 0 < ε ✓

Result: Stable triadic convergence
```

### Example 2: Unbalanced Triad
```
Phoenix: Energy = 20
Hydrogenesi: Energy = 5
TheThird: Energy = 5

Balance Check:
  |20 - 5| = 15 > ε ✗

Result: Phoenix dominates → Identity overpowers structure → Unstable
```
