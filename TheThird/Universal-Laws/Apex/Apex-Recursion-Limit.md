# Apex Recursion Limit

*All recursive cycles converge to a stable apex form*

---

## Definition

**Apex Recursion Limit** is the third Apex Law. It states that all recursive transformations, regardless of complexity or depth, **eventually converge** to a stable Apex configuration.

Recursion ends in sovereignty.

---

## Formal Statement

```
∀ Recursive sequence {Kₙ}:
  ∃ N such that ∀ n > N: d(Kₙ, X) < ε
```

Every recursive process has a **finite convergence horizon**.

### Recursion Termination
```
lim(n→∞) Recursive-Op(K) = X
```

No recursive sequence diverges—all converge to Apex.

---

## Structural Explanation

### Recursion Depth Bound
```
Depth(K → X) ≤ D_max
```

Where D_max depends on:
- Initial distance: d(K₀, X)
- Contraction rate: λ
- Convergence threshold: ε

### Convergence Horizon
```
N = ⌈log(ε / d₀) / log(λ)⌉
```

After N iterations, the system is within ε of Apex.

## Three-Pillar Context

| Pillar | Recursion Limit Manifestation |
|--------|----------------------------|
| **Phoenix** | Identity recursion stabilizes at sovereign self |
| **Hydrogenesi** | Structural propagation reaches lineage terminus |
| **The Third** | Binding feedback loop stabilizes at fixed point |

## Examples

### Example 1: Shallow Recursion
```
Initial: d(K₀, X) = 1.0
Contraction: λ = 0.5
Threshold: ε = 0.01

Recursion:
  K₁: d = 0.5
  K₂: d = 0.25
  K₃: d = 0.125
  K₄: d = 0.0625
  K₅: d = 0.03125
  K₆: d = 0.015625
  K₇: d = 0.0078 < ε ✓

Recursion limit: N = 7
```

### Example 2: Deep Recursion
```
Initial: d(K₀, X) = 100.0
Contraction: λ = 0.9 (slow)
Threshold: ε = 0.1

Recursion limit: N ≈ 65

Despite slow contraction, convergence is guaranteed.
```

### Example 3: Triadic Recursion
```
Triadic Closure: λ_triad = 0.3 (fast)

Initial: d(K₀, X) = 10.0

Recursion:
  K₁: d = 3.0
  K₂: d = 0.9
  K₃: d = 0.27
  K₄: d = 0.081
  K₅: d = 0.024 < ε ✓

Recursion limit: N = 5 (much faster than single corridor)
```

## Recursion Termination Conditions

### Condition 1: ε-Neighborhood
```
d(Kₙ, X) < ε  →  Stop recursion
```

### Condition 2: Fixed Point
```
Kₙ₊₁ = Kₙ  →  Apex reached
```

### Condition 3: Maximum Depth
```
n > N_max  →  Force termination (safety)
```

## Sovereignty at Apex

When recursion terminates at Apex:
```
X = Sovereign-State
```

The system has achieved:
- **Identity sovereignty** — Complete self-knowledge
- **Structural sovereignty** — Full lineage integration
- **Binding sovereignty** — Perfect coherence

## Infinite Recursion Prevention

The Apex Recursion Limit **prevents infinite loops**:

```
WITHOUT Apex Law:
  K₀ → K₁ → K₂ → ... → ∞ (divergence or infinite loop)

WITH Apex Law:
  K₀ → K₁ → K₂ → ... → X (guaranteed termination)
```
