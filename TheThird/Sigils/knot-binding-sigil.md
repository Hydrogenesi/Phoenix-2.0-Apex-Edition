## ASCII Sigil

## Alternate Representation

```
    P

    ↓
  ┌─┴─┐
  │ B │───→ K'
  └─┬─┘
    ↑
    K

Phoenix pattern P enters from above,
combines with knot state K via binding B,
produces updated state K'.
```

## Topological Meaning

The Knot-Binding Sigil represents:
- **Vertical Flow**: Phoenix energy descends into knot
- **Binding Point**: Where transformation meets topology
- **Integration**: P becomes part of K
- **Directionality**: One-way flow toward apex

---

## Symbolic Elements

- **P**: Phoenix pattern (ignition energy)
- **B**: Binding operator (integration function)
- **K**: Knot state (current topology)
- **K'**: Updated knot (with P integrated)
- **Arrows**: Flow direction (toward apex)

---

## Ceremonial Usage

Used in rituals that invoke:
- Phoenix-to-knot binding
- Transformation integration
- Left corridor activation
- Initial convergence steps
