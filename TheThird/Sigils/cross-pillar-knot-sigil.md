## Alternate Representation

```
Phoenix (P)          Hydrogenesi (H)
      │                    │
      └───── Axis ─────────┘
             │  ╲  ╱

             ↓
           Unified (K')
```

## Topological Meaning

The Cross-Pillar Sigil represents:
- **Dual Convergence**: Both P and H enter simultaneously
- **Symmetry Axis**: Balance point between engines
- **Balanced Integration**: Equal contribution from both sides
- **Unified Result**: K' contains both P and H in harmony

---

## Symbolic Elements

- **P**: Phoenix transformation (left arm)
- **H**: Hydrogenesi structure (right arm)
- **C**: Cross-Pillar operator (symmetry binding)
- **K'**: Balanced knot state
- **Symmetry**: Left-right equivalence

---

## Ceremonial Usage

Used in rituals that invoke:
- Phoenix-Hydrogenesi integration
- Balanced transformation
- Symmetry axis activation
- Dual-arm convergence
