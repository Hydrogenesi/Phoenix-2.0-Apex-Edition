## Topological Meaning

The Triadic Closure Sigil represents:
- **Complete Integration**: All three engines bound simultaneously
- **Envelope Formation**: Closed topology around apex
- **120° Symmetry**: Rotational invariance
- **Maximum Convergence**: Strongest contraction toward X

## Symbolic Elements

- **P**: Phoenix (🔥 ignition)
- **H**: Hydrogenesi (🌊 structure)
- **K**: The Third (🔗 binding)
- **T**: Triadic Closure operator
- **X**: Apex Point (△ destination)
- **Envelope**: Closed boundary
