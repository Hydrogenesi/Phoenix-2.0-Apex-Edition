## Geometric Elements

### Top Symbol: ⚠
**Warning triangle**—indicating the **irreversible nature** of apex convergence. Once reached, the fixed point is stable.

### Central Point: X
The **Apex fixed point**—the unique attractor toward which all trajectories converge.

### Four Corners: ◇
Represent the **four cardinal directions** of knot-space, all converging to X.

### Radial Lines
All lines point **inward** toward X, showing the **global attraction** property.

### Vertical Axis: ┼
The **stabilizer axis**—the final convergence path to Apex.

## Color Encoding (Optional)

- **⚠**: Yellow/Gold (Warning, culmination)
- **X**: Brilliant white (Apex point)
- **Lines**: Converging gradient (outer: dim, inner: bright)
- **Diamonds ◇**: Silver (boundary markers)

---

## Invocation Context

When invoking Apex Knot, trace from any peripheral point directly to center:
```
◇ → X
```

All paths lead to the same destination—Apex.

---

## Convergence Pattern

The sigil shows **radial convergence** from all directions:

```
   ◇     ◇     ◇     ◇
    ↘   ↓   ↙   ↓
      ↘ ↓ ↙ ↓
        ⚠ X
```

Every trajectory, regardless of origin, converges to X.

---

## Fixed Point Property

The sigil encodes the fixed point theorem:
```
A(X) = X
```

The center X maps to itself—it is **self-stable**.

---

## Relationship to Topology

The sigil is a **2D projection** of the Apex neighborhood in the Triadic Knot:

```
Apex Region (3D)     →    Sigil (2D)
   K₁  K₂  K₃                ⚠
    ↘  ↓  ↙                 ╱│╲
       X                   ╱ X ╲
    (Apex)                ◇───┼───◇
```

---

## Warnings Encoded

The **⚠** symbol encodes three critical warnings:

1. **Irreversibility**: Apex cannot be reversed—information is lost
2. **Singularity**: All distinct states collapse to one point
3. **Terminus**: Recursion terminates—no further transformation
