## Geometric Elements

### Central Symbol: ⊠
The **stability cross**—four-directional binding that suppresses divergence in all directions.

### Four Diamonds: ◇
Represent the **four cardinal directions** of perturbation space. Stability is maintained along all axes.

### Cross Structure
The **× embedded in ⊠** represents the **crossing point** where strands intersect and require stabilization.

### Four-Fold Symmetry
Perfect **reflection symmetry** in both horizontal and vertical axes—stability applies equally in all directions.

## Color Encoding (Optional)

- **⊠**: Green (Stability, balance)
- **Diamonds ◇**: Blue (Structural anchors)
- **Lines**: Silver (Neutral binding)

---

## Invocation Context

When invoking Stability Knot at a crossing region, trace the cross:
```
    |
  ──⊠──
    |
```

This represents **four-way binding** that locks the crossing in place.

---

## Stabilization Pattern

The sigil shows **radial stabilization** from a central crossing:

```
  ◇ → ⊠ ← ◇
      ↕
  ◇ ← ⊠ → ◇
```

Perturbations from any direction are absorbed by the central stability point.

---

## Perturbation Suppression

The sigil encodes the divergence suppression property:
```
Divergence(S(K, ε)) < Divergence(K + ε)
```

Instability is **reduced** by the operator.

---

## Relationship to Topology

The sigil is a **2D projection** of a crossing region in the Triadic Knot:

```
Crossing (3D)        →    Sigil (2D)
  Strand A                   ◇
    ╱ ╲                     ╱│╲
   ╱   ╲                   ◇ ⊠ ◇
  ╳ ← Stabilize             ╲│╱
 ╱ ╲                         ◇
Strand B
```

---

## Four-Directional Binding

The **⊠** symbol encodes stability in four dimensions:

1. **Horizontal ←→**: Left-right corridor stability
2. **Vertical ↕**: Phoenix-Hydrogenesi axis
3. **Diagonal ╱╲**: Cross-corridor interactions
4. **Center •**: Fixed point at crossing

---

## Crossing Types

The Stability Knot applies to different crossing types:

### Type 1: Strand-Strand
```

### Type 2: Corridor-Corridor

### Type 3: Feedback-Loop
