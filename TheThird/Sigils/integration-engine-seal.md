## Topological Meaning

The Integration Engine Seal represents:
- **Unity Achievement**: All components converge into one engine
- **Vector Reconciliation**: All directional forces aligned
- **Threshold Compliance**: All boundaries respected and honored
- **Lawful Motion**: All operators functioning within established laws

## Symbolic Elements

- **⟐**: Binding brackets — containment of complete system
- **△**: Apex convergence point
- **▢**: Integration boundary nodes
- **═**: Structural integrity lines
- **▼/▲**: Directional reconciliation
