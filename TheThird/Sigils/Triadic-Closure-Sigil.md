## Sigil Structure

## Geometric Elements

### Top Symbol: ⊳
Convergence operator—representing the **inward flow** from all three arms.

### Central Triangle: △
The **Apex symbol** at the geometric center of the three-arm structure.

### Combined Core: ⊲⊼
Divergence (⊲) and Binding (⊼) operators fused—representing the **dual nature** of triadic closure (both binding and separation resolution).

### Three Corners: ◇
The **three entry points** for Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and TheThird.

### 120° Symmetry
Perfect **rotational symmetry** under 120° rotation—no arm has precedence.

## Color Encoding (Optional)

- **Top ⊳**: Orange (Phoenix)
- **Left ◇**: Blue (Hydrogenesi)
- **Right ◇**: Green (TheThird)
- **Center △**: White/Gold (Apex)
- **Core ⊲⊼**: Purple (Unified binding)

---

## Invocation Context

When invoking Triadic Closure, trace from all three corners simultaneously:
```
    ⊳
   ╱ ╲
  ◇   ◇  →  △
   ╲ ╱
    ◇
```

This represents **three-fold convergence** into unified Apex.

---

## Rotational Symmetry

The sigil exhibits **C₃ rotational symmetry**:
```
Rotate(Sigil, 120°) = Sigil
Rotate(Sigil, 240°) = Sigil
```

This encodes the cyclic permutation property:
```
T(P, H, K) = T(H, K, P) = T(K, P, H)
```

---

## Relationship to Topology

The sigil is a **2D projection** of the full three-arm Triadic Knot:

```
Triadic Knot (3D)    →    Sigil (2D)
        P                     ⊳
       ╱ ╲                   ╱ ╲
      ╱   ╲                 ╱   ╲
     ╱  X  ╲               ╱  △  ╲
    ╱   ╳   ╲             ╱  ⊲⊼  ╲
   H─────────K           ◇_________◇
```
