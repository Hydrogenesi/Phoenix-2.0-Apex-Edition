# Triadic Knot — Geometry Atlas

## Overview

The Triadic Knot is the geometric foundation of The Third Pillar. It represents the complete binding structure where Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and the Apex Convergence Point unite in a stable, recursive form.

## Geometric Structure

### The Envelope

The Triadic Knot envelope is the complete boundary that contains all three arm corridors and their intersections. It forms a closed surface that preserves the 120° rotational symmetry.

### The Three Arm Corridors

1. **Left Arm Corridor** — Phoenix domain, extends from left vertex to central interior
2. **Right Arm Corridor** — Hydrogenesi domain, extends from right vertex to central interior  
3. **Apex Arm Corridor** — Convergence domain, extends from apex vertex to central interior

### Symmetry Axes

- **Primary Axis** — Vertical line through Apex Convergence Point
- **Left-Right Axis** — Horizontal line connecting Phoenix and Hydrogenesi vertices
- **Stabilizer Axis** — Rotational axis preserving 120° symmetry

## Geometric Domains

Each operator in the Third Pillar governs a specific geometric domain within the Triadic Knot:

- **Knot-Binding** operates in the left arm corridor leading to the central interior
- **Cross-Pillar Knot** operates along the left-right corridor and symmetry axis
- **Triadic Closure** operates over the full envelope, including all crossings
- **Apex Knot** operates in the apex neighborhood along the stabilizer axis
- **Stability Knot** operates at crossing regions where strands intersect

---

## Forbidden Zones

Certain regions of the Triadic Knot are protected by invariant preservation:

- **Apex Fixed Point** — The unique point where \(A(X) = X\)
- **Singularity Boundaries** — Zones where operators would violate contraction
- **Divergence Regions** — Areas outside the convergence basin
