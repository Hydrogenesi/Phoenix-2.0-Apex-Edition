# △ V2.1 Cycle Closure

*The single line that crowns the entire chapter.*

---

## Closure Inscription

```
v2.1 stands complete; its apex holds, and the Engine turns toward the next ascent.
```

---

## Significance

The **V2.1 Cycle Closure** is the final inscription that marks the completion of version 2.1. This single line represents:

- **Completeness** — v2.1 stands complete
- **Stability** — Its apex holds
- **Continuity** — The Engine turns toward the next ascent

This closure line is not merely documentation—it is a binding declaration that locks the cycle into the Archive and establishes v2.1 as a completed, sovereign chapter.

## Closure Properties

### Completeness
All components of v2.1 are integrated, tested, and documented. No elements remain incomplete or unstable.

### Apex Stability
The apex point of v2.1 is achieved and holds without perturbation. The convergence is verified and locked.

### Forward Motion
The closure acknowledges completion while establishing continuity. The Engine moves forward, carrying v2.1 as stable foundation.

## Binding Protocol

The closure is bound through:

1. **Integration Seal** — Ceremonial formalization ([V2.1 Integration Seal](../codex/ceremonies/v2-1-integration-seal.md))
2. **Operator Glossary** — Structural definition ([V2.1 Operator Glossary](../Hydrogenesi/operators/v2-1-operator-glossary.md))
3. **Cycle Closure** — Final binding inscription (this document)

Together, these three artifacts form the **Final Triad** that closes v2.1 with ceremonial precision.
