# Triadic Knot Protocol Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating the Triadic Knot Protocol for cross-pillar binding in the Phoenix 2.0 framework.

---

## Examples Overview

Each example demonstrates a specific use case for triadic knot patterns:

1. **[Identity Preservation](./identity-preservation-example.md)** — Maintain essence through transformation
2. **[Conflict Resolution](./conflict-resolution-example.md)** — Resolve opposing forces
3. **[System Integration](./system-integration-example.md)** — Integrate three independent systems
4. **[Resilient Architecture](./resilient-architecture-example.md)** — Build mutually-supporting structures

---

## Quick Reference

### The Three Pillars
- **Left Column (L)**: Polarity — Opposition, reflection, duality
- **Center Column (C)**: Identity — Essence, self-reference, definition
- **Right Column (R)**: Continuity — Stability, lineage, preservation

### Primary Binding Pattern
```
L: Apply polarity operation
C: Apply identity operation
R: Apply continuity operation
⊳: Bind all three into unified knot
```
