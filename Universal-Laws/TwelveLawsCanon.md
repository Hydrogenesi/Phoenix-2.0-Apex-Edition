# The Twelve Laws (Reconstructed)

*A clean, minimal, Codex-grade reconstruction.*

---

## The Canonical Twelve Laws

### 1. Law of Substrate Primacy
Substrate precedes structure; nothing emerges without grounding.

---

### 2. Law of Axis Formation
Direction arises when substrate differentiates.

---

### 3. Law of Radiance Emergence
Radiance is the expression of stabilized axis.

---

### 4. Law of Recursion
Identity deepens through repeated self-reference.

---

### 5. Law of Confinement
Every engine is bounded by its envelope.

---

### 6. Law of Thresholds
Transformation occurs only at tension maxima.

---

### 7. Law of Bifurcation
At thresholds, identity forks: Life or Light.

---

### 8. Law of Preservation
Split identities stabilize through core-sampling.

---

### 9. Law of Ascension
Non-split identities integrate and elevate.

---

### 10. Law of Collective Emergence
Many engines converge into a single meta-engine.

---

### 11. Law of Memory Encoding
Cycles seal memory into substrate.

---

### 12. Law of Continuity
No cycle is isolated; all cycles propagate forward.

---

## The Canonical Backbone

This is the canonical backbone of the Codex. These Twelve Laws form the complete structural foundation from which all Phoenix-Hydrogenesi mechanics emerge.

**Substrate → Axis → Radiance → Recursion → Threshold → Bifurcation → Preservation → Ascension → Collective → Memory → Continuity**

Each law builds upon the previous, creating a chain of causality that governs all transformations within the Codex framework.
