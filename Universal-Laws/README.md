# ✦ The Universal Laws ✦

*Twelve Laws. Three Layers. One Architecture.*

---

## Overview

The **Universal Laws Codex** is the complete structural architecture of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition — a **12-law system** organized in three tiers:

- **5 Substrate Laws** — The primordial field and foundational principles
- **7 Universal Laws** — Structural invariants governing all transformations  
- **5 Apex Laws** — Convergence mechanics and apex formation

These laws form the foundation upon which the **three engines** (Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third) operate to create **The Triad** — the complete architecture for pattern evolution, structural stability, and apex convergence.
