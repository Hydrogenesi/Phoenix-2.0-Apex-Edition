# Geometric Sigil Atlas

## Construction Patterns and Sacred Geometry

This atlas documents the geometric construction principles underlying all sigils in Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition. Every sigil follows sacred geometric patterns—proportions, symmetries, and relationships that resonate with fundamental mathematical and metaphysical principles.

## Primary Construction Methods

**Circle Division**: All circular sigils use 8-fold or 12-fold division. Eight represents Substrate/Universal/Apex + five elements + balance. Twelve represents completion (3 layers × 4 cardinal directions).

**Triangle Orientation**: Upward △ indicates ascension (Substrate→Apex). Downward ▽ indicates descent (Apex→Substrate) or reflection. Horizontal orientation indicates balance/Universal layer.

**Square Stability**: Square forms provide grounding. Internal divisions follow golden ratio proportions. Diagonal lines connect corners through center, creating X patterns representing synthesis.

## Golden Ratio Application

Many sigils incorporate φ (phi) = 1.618 proportions:
- Universal sigil complexity relative to Substrate: 1.618:1
- Apex sigil complexity relative to Universal: 1.618:1  
- Creating exponential progression: 1, φ, φ², φ³...

## Symmetry Classes

**Radial Symmetry**: Apex sigils—8-fold rotational symmetry minimum. Represents completeness and canonical perfection.

**Axial Symmetry**: Universal sigils—2-fold or 4-fold reflective symmetry. Represents Law-governed balance and polarity.

**Asymmetric**: Substrate sigils may lack perfect symmetry, representing primitive, unrefined nature. However, asymmetry still follows geometric constraints.

## Construction Example: Apex Synthesis Mark ⧈

1. Draw base circle (unit radius)
2. Inscribe regular hexagon (side length = radius)
3. Draw second hexagon rotated 30°
4. Overlap at center creating 12-pointed star
5. Connect star points creating web pattern
6. Apply golden ratio to line weights

Result: Perfect synthesis sigil with 12-fold symmetry.

## Fractal Properties

Apex sigils contain self-similar patterns. The ⊛ Canon Transform sigil, when magnified, reveals smaller ⊛ patterns in each radial arm. This fractal nature connects to [recursion-atlas.md](recursion-atlas.md) patterns.

## Practical Geometry

To draw sigils accurately: use compass and straightedge. All constructions possible with classical tools. Digital renderings must preserve exact geometric ratios—no approximation.
