# Substrate Sigils

## Foundation Layer Symbolism

Substrate sigils represent the primitive operations and foundational structures of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition. These elemental marks employ basic geometric forms—circle, triangle, square—as building blocks, combining them into simple yet meaningful patterns that ground all higher-level symbolic operations.

```
    SUBSTRATE SIGIL PRIMITIVES
    
    ○  CIRCLE      △  TRIANGLE    □  SQUARE
    [Unity]        [Direction]    [Stability]
    
    ◐  HALF        ▽  INVERSE     ◇  DIAMOND
    [Duality]      [Reflection]   [Synthesis]
```

## Primary Substrate Sigils

**Transform Sigil** `⟲`: Circular arrow indicating state transformation. Represents map, filter, and reduce operations. The continuous curve symbolizes flow through transformation space while maintaining operational identity.

**Storage Sigil** `▣`: Square with internal division, representing contained data structures. The boundaries indicate persistence boundaries, internal lines show organizational structure. Used for all substrate-level storage operations.

**Flow Sigil** `⥤`: Rightward arrow with tail, indicating directional execution flow. Represents sequencing, branching, and control structures. The arrow head points toward future execution states.

**Aggregate Sigil** `⊕`: Circle with internal cross, symbolizing combination of multiple inputs into unified output. The quadrants represent input channels, center represents merged result.

## Geometric Principles

Substrate sigils obey geometric constraints:
- **Symmetry**: Primary axis symmetry (vertical or horizontal)
- **Simplicity**: Maximum 3 primitive shapes per sigil
- **Connectivity**: All elements topologically connected
- **Boundedness**: Finite geometric extent

## Sigil Composition

Complex substrate operations combine primitive sigils. A transform-then-store operation uses: `⟲→▣`. The arrow indicates sequential composition. Parallel operations use vertical stacking: 
```
⟲
⊕
```

## Invocation Patterns

Sigils mark source code, documentation, and ritual invocations. In code comments: `// SIGIL:⟲` marks transform operations. In rituals, sigils are drawn or spoken to invoke corresponding operations.
