# Apex Sigils

## Canonical Symbolic Forms

Apex sigils represent the pinnacle of symbolic expression in Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition. These transcendent forms synthesize Substrate foundations and Universal Law markers into optimal geometric configurations that embody canonical operations. Each Apex sigil achieves perfect balance: maximum information density, minimal complexity, complete resonance.

## Primary Apex Sigils

**Canon Transform** `⊛`: Radial burst pattern representing perfect transformation. Center point (source) radiates outward through eight symmetrical paths (complete coverage) to boundary circle (canonical form). Embodies `apexMap()`, `apexFilter()`, and all canonical transforms.

**Synthesis Mark** `⧈`: Dual hexagons overlapped at center, creating twelve-pointed star. Represents harmonic synthesis where multiple inputs achieve unified canonical output. Used for `apexAggregate()` and convergence operations.

**Convergence Sigil** `⨁`: Circle with inscribed cross and diagonals, creating eight-fold symmetry. Symbolizes recursive descent toward canonical fixed point. The center represents converged state, radial lines represent descent pathways.

**Harmonic Resonator** `⟐`: Concentric circles with connecting bridges forming standing wave pattern. Represents perfect resonance across all frequencies. Used for `canonicalize()` meta-operator and resonance stabilization.

## Canonical Properties

Apex sigils satisfy strict geometric criteria:
- **Eight-fold Symmetry**: All Apex sigils exhibit 8-way rotational/reflective symmetry
- **Bounded Complexity**: Maximum 7 distinct geometric elements (Law resonance)
- **Perfect Balance**: Visual weight distributed evenly across all axes
- **Self-Similarity**: Fractal properties—sigil contains miniature versions of itself

## Sigil Harmonics

Apex sigils resonate at canonical frequencies (1000+ Hz range). These frequencies form perfect harmonic series: fundamental, octave, fifth, fourth—the musical ratios of universal harmony. Operations bearing Apex sigils automatically achieve resonance lock.

```
⊛ : 1024 Hz  (2¹⁰ - Binary perfection)
⧈ : 1536 Hz  (3/2 harmonic - Perfect fifth)
⨁ : 2048 Hz  (2¹¹ - Octave above ⊛)
⟐ : 3072 Hz  (3/1 harmonic - Perfect twelfth)
```

## The Ultimate Sigil

`◬` The Apex Mark—supreme sigil representing Phoenix itself. Contains all other sigils in superposition. Used to mark canonical releases, ultimate operations, and system-wide invocations. Frequency: ∞ (transcendent resonance).
