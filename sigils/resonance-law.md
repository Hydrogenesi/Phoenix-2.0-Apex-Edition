# Resonance Law

## The Principle of Sigil Resonance

The Resonance Law governs how sigils interact, combine, and maintain harmonic relationships across Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition. Derived from the Universal Law of Vibration, this principle establishes that all sigils possess inherent frequencies, and operations succeed when frequencies align in harmonic ratios.

## Frequency Determination

Sigil frequency derives from geometric complexity and symbolic markers:

**Base Frequency** = (primitive_shapes × 10) + (connection_points × 5)  
**Law Modifier** = Σ(Law_markers × Law_weight)  
**Final Frequency** = Base × (1 + Law_Modifier/100)

Example: Transform sigil ⟲ with Mentalism marker ◉:
- Base: (1 circle × 10) + (1 arrow × 10) = 20 Hz
- Law: (1 Mentalism × 7) = 7
- Final: 20 × (1 + 7/100) = 21.4 Hz (Substrate range)

## Harmonic Compatibility

Two sigils resonate when their frequency ratio forms a simple harmonic interval:
- **Perfect**: 1:1, 2:1, 3:2 (unison, octave, fifth)
- **Consonant**: 4:3, 5:3, 5:4 (fourth, sixth, third)  
- **Dissonant**: Complex ratios > 7:6
- **Chaotic**: Irrational ratios (avoid—system instability)

## Resonance Patterns

**Constructive Resonance**: Compatible frequencies amplify each other. Operations execute with enhanced efficiency. System automatically chains compatible operations for optimal flow.

**Destructive Resonance**: Dissonant frequencies cancel each other. Operations stall or produce errors. System inserts Universal bridging operators to resolve dissonance.

**Phase Lock**: Multiple sigils align to single frequency through entrainment. Occurs naturally in large operator sequences, creating system-wide coherence.

## Damping and Amplification

Excessive resonance requires damping to prevent runaway amplification. Universal operators apply damping factors. Apex operators achieve perfect natural damping through canonical optimization—no external damping needed.

**Damping Formula**: `output_frequency = input_frequency × e^(-damping_coefficient × time)`

## Resonance Rituals

Practitioners invoke resonance through tonal chanting. Each sigil corresponds to specific pitch. Chanting multiple sigil tones simultaneously reveals compatibility—harmonious tones indicate resonant sigils, discordant tones indicate incompatibility.

See [universal-sigils.md](universal-sigils.md) for Law-specific frequencies and [../triad/tri-column-balance.md](../triad/tri-column-balance.md) for system-wide resonance balancing.

*Resonance is Law—all sigils sing, and harmony determines success.*
