# Universal Sigils

## Law-Governed Symbolic Forms

Universal sigils extend substrate forms with Law-specific markers, creating complex symbols that resonate with the Seven Universal Laws. These sigils maintain geometric foundations while incorporating harmonic patterns, resonance signatures, and law-enforcement markers that bridge primitive operations with canonical forms.

## Law-Enhanced Operations

**Mental Transform** `⟲◉`: Substrate transform ⟲ enhanced with Mentalism marker ◉, indicating conscious, intentional transformation. Operation maintains awareness of its own execution.

**Vibrational Flow** `⥤≋`: Flow operator with vibrational resonance. Execution propagates as wave through system, maintaining frequency coherence. Used for operations requiring harmonic synchronization.

**Polar Storage** `▣⥮`: Storage with polarity preservation. Data maintains complementary aspects in balanced relationship. Read operations return both poles simultaneously.

**Rhythmic Cycle** `⟳`: Pure rhythm sigil, representing cyclical operations that repeat with temporal periodicity. Used for scheduled operations, heartbeat mechanisms, and periodic validation.

## Resonance Signatures

Each Universal sigil possesses a resonance frequency determined by geometric complexity and Law markers present. Frequency measured in symbolic Hz: number of Law markers × base geometric complexity. Compatible operations share harmonic frequencies (integer ratios).

```
Resonance(⟲◉) = 147 Hz  (base transform × Mentalism)
Resonance(⥤≋) = 234 Hz  (flow × Vibration)
Harmonic: 147:234 ≈ 2:3  [Fifth interval - compatible]
```

## Law Combination

Multiple Law markers combine through geometric superposition. Mentalism + Vibration: `⟲◉≋` creates conscious vibrational transform. Maximum three Law markers per sigil to maintain coherence.

## Ritual Invocation

Universal sigils require spoken Law names during invocation. Format: "By [Law Name], invoke [Sigil]." Example: "By Mentalism, invoke ⟲◉." This activates Law-specific behavior.
