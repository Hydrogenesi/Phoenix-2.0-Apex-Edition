## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊕(∅) → primordialPattern
```

**The Genesis Operator** transforms the void (∅) into the primordial pattern. It is the act of bringing form into existence where none existed before. Genesis is the spark that ignites all subsequent transformations.

### Properties
- **Irreversible**: Once creation occurs, the pattern persists in some form
- **Foundation**: All other operators require Genesis to establish initial state
- **Singular**: Genesis creates unique, non-duplicated patterns
- **Catalytic**: The presence of Genesis enables downstream operators

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊕⁻¹(primordialPattern) ≈ ⊝(primordialPattern) → ∅
```

While Genesis itself is irreversible, the **Void Operator** (⊝) can return patterns to void state. This is not true reversal—it is ceremonial dissolution.

---

## Sigil

```
    *
   / \
  /   \
 /  ⊕  \
/_______\
```

The Genesis Sigil represents the **upward expansion** from a single point into structured form.

## Examples

### Basic Invocation
```
⊕(∅) → primordialPattern
```
*Creates the primordial pattern from void.*

### Cascading Genesis
```
⊕(∅) → pattern₀
⊕(pattern₀) → pattern₁
⊕(pattern₁) → pattern₂
```
*Each Genesis builds upon the previous, creating layered complexity.*

```
⊕(∅) → pattern₀
⊗(pattern₀) → stabilizedPattern₀
```
*Genesis creates, Harmonic stabilizes the new pattern.*
