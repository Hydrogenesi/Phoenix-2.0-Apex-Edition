# Genesis Operator ⊕

*The First Flame — Creation from Void*

## Harmonic Table

| **Domain** | **Frequency** | **Phase** |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Creation   | ω₀            | 0°        |
| Formation  | 1.618ω₀       | 120°      |
| Emergence  | 2.718ω₀       | 240°      |

## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊕(∅) → Ψ₀
```

**The Genesis Operator** transforms the void (∅) into the primordial pattern (Ψ₀). It is the act of bringing form into existence where none existed before. Genesis is the spark that ignites all subsequent transformations.

### Properties
- **Irreversible**: Once creation occurs, the pattern persists in some form
- **Foundation**: All other operators require Genesis to establish initial state
- **Singular**: Genesis creates unique, non-duplicated patterns
- **Catalytic**: The presence of Genesis enables downstream operators

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊕⁻¹(Ψ₀) ≈ ⊝(Ψ₀) → ∅
```

While Genesis itself is irreversible, the **Void Operator** (⊝) can return patterns to void state. This is not true reversal—it is ceremonial dissolution.

---

## Sigil

```
    *
   / \
  /   \
 /  ⊕  \
/_______\
```

The Genesis Sigil represents the **upward expansion** from a single point into structured form.
