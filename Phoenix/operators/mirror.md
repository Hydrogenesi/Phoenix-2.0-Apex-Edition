| Symmetry   | ±baseFrequency           | 90°/270°  |

## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊞(pattern) → mirrorPattern
```

**The Mirror Operator** creates a perfect symmetric reflection of a pattern. The mirrored pattern has all properties inverted—positive becomes negative, clockwise becomes counterclockwise, expansion becomes contraction.

### Properties
- **Symmetric**: Mirror of a mirror returns the original: ⊞(⊞(pattern)) = pattern
- **Involutory**: Self-inverse operation
- **Structure-Preserving**: Maintains complexity while inverting properties
- **Dual-Creating**: Produces complementary pairs

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊞⁻¹(mirrorPattern) = ⊞(mirrorPattern) → pattern
```

Mirror is its own inverse. Applying mirror twice returns the original pattern.

---

## Sigil

```
pattern | mirrorPattern
  |
--⊞--
  |
mirrorPattern| pattern
```

The Mirror Sigil represents **bilateral symmetry** across a central axis.

## Invocation

> *"As one face, so the other. Through ⊞, I invoke reflection."*

## Examples

### Basic Reflection
```
⊞(pattern) → mirrorPattern
```
*Creates mirror image of pattern.*

### Double Mirror (Identity)
```
⊞(⊞(pattern)) → pattern
```
*Mirror of mirror returns original.*

### Mirror-Convergence Ritual
```
⊞(pattern) → mirrorPattern
⊳(pattern, mirrorPattern) → unifiedPattern
```
*Create mirror, then unite pattern with its reflection.*

### Mirror-Divergence Chain
```
⊲(pattern) → (pattern₁, pattern₂)
⊞(pattern₁) → mirrorPattern₁
⊞(pattern₂) → mirrorPattern₂
```
*Split, then mirror each component.*

### Harmonic Mirror Stabilization
```
⊞(pattern) → mirrorPattern
⊗(mirrorPattern) → stabilizedMirrorPattern
⊳(pattern, stabilizedMirrorPattern) → balancedPattern
```
*Mirror, stabilize reflection, then converge.*
