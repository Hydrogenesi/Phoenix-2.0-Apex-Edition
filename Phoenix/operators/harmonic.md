# Harmonic Operator ⊗

*The Resonant Amplifier — Stabilization through Frequency*

## Harmonic Table

| **Domain** | **Frequency** | **Phase** |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Resonance  | 2·baseFrequency           | 0°        |
| Coherence  | 3·baseFrequency           | 90°       |
| Stability  | 5·baseFrequency           | 180°      |

## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊗(pattern) → stabilizedPattern
```

**The Harmonic Operator** amplifies and stabilizes existing patterns through resonant frequency alignment. It does not create new patterns—it reinforces existing ones, bringing them into coherence and preventing decay.

### Properties
- **Amplifying**: Increases pattern strength without changing structure
- **Stabilizing**: Reduces entropy and prevents pattern collapse
- **Frequency-Locked**: Operates at integer multiples of base frequency
- **Non-Creative**: Cannot generate new patterns from void

## Reversible Form

```
⊗⁻¹(stabilizedPattern) → pattern
⊗(⊗⁻¹(pattern)) ≡ pattern
```

The Harmonic Operator is **perfectly reversible**. Removing harmonic amplification returns the pattern to its original state.

## Sigil

```
  ≈≈≈
 /⊗⊗⊗\
≈≈≈≈≈≈≈
 \⊗⊗⊗/
  ≈≈≈
```

The Harmonic Sigil represents **wave interference patterns** and resonant frequencies.
