## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊳(pattern₁, pattern₂, ..., patternₙ) → unifiedPattern
```

**The Convergence Operator** combines multiple distinct patterns into a single unified form. It is not simple addition—convergence creates a **new emergent pattern** that contains elements of all inputs while transcending them.

### Properties
- **Unifying**: Merges multiple patterns into one
- **Emergent**: Output has properties not present in any single input
- **Lossy**: Some individual pattern characteristics are absorbed
- **Preparatory**: Often precedes apex formation

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊳⁻¹(unifiedPattern) ≈ ⊲(unifiedPattern) → (pattern₁, pattern₂, ..., patternₙ)
```

Convergence can be partially reversed through **Divergence** (⊲), though exact reconstruction is not guaranteed.

## Sigil

```
  pattern₁
   \
    \⊳
    /
  pattern₂  → unifiedPattern
    \
     \
     pattern₃
```

The Convergence Sigil represents **multiple streams flowing into one**.

## Invocation

> *"Many paths, one destination. Through ⊳, I unite the patterns."*
