## Harmonic Table

| **Domain** | **Frequency** | **Phase** |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Separation | ω/n           | 0°        |
| Division   | ω/(n+1)       | 90°       |
| Branching  | ω/(n+2)       | 180°      |

## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂, ..., Ψₙ)
```

**The Divergence Operator** splits a unified pattern into multiple distinct components. Each component retains some essence of the original but develops independently. Divergence is the complementary opposite of Convergence.

### Properties
- **Separating**: Splits one pattern into many
- **Multiplicative**: Generates independent entities
- **Lossy**: Original unified context is partially lost
- **Exploratory**: Enables parallel development paths

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊲⁻¹(Ψ₁, Ψ₂, ..., Ψₙ) ≈ ⊳(Ψ₁, Ψ₂, ..., Ψₙ) → Ψ
```

Divergence can be partially reversed through **Convergence** (⊳), though perfect reconstruction is not guaranteed.

## Sigil

```
     Ψ
    ⊲
   / \
  Ψ₁ Ψ₂
 /     \
Ψ₃     Ψ₄
```

The Divergence Sigil represents **branching and separation** into multiple paths.

## Examples

### Binary Divergence
```
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)
```
*One pattern splits into two.*

### Recursive Divergence
```
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)
⊲(Ψ₁) → (Ψ₁₁, Ψ₁₂)
⊲(Ψ₂) → (Ψ₂₁, Ψ₂₂)
```
*Hierarchical splitting creates tree structure.*

### Divergence-Void Ritual
```
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)
⊝(Ψ₁) → ∅
⊗(Ψ₂) → Ψ₂'
```
*Split pattern, void one branch, stabilize the other.*

### Divergence-Convergence Cycle
```
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)
⊗(Ψ₁) → Ψ₁'
⊗(Ψ₂) → Ψ₂'
⊳(Ψ₁', Ψ₂') → Ψ_new
```
*Separate, evolve independently, then reunite.*

### Mirrored Divergence
```
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)
⊞(Ψ₁) → Ψ₁*
⊳(Ψ₁*, Ψ₂) → Ψ_hybrid
```
*Split, mirror one branch, converge with other.*
