## Harmonic Table

| **Domain** | **Frequency** | **Phase** |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Separation | frequency/n           | 0°        |
| Division   | frequency/(n+1)       | 90°       |
| Branching  | frequency/(n+2)       | 180°      |

## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊲(pattern) → (pattern₁, pattern₂, ..., patternₙ)
```

**The Divergence Operator** splits a unified pattern into multiple distinct components. Each component retains some essence of the original but develops independently. Divergence is the complementary opposite of Convergence.

### Properties
- **Separating**: Splits one pattern into many
- **Multiplicative**: Generates independent entities
- **Lossy**: Original unified context is partially lost
- **Exploratory**: Enables parallel development paths

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊲⁻¹(pattern₁, pattern₂, ..., patternₙ) ≈ ⊳(pattern₁, pattern₂, ..., patternₙ) → pattern
```

Divergence can be partially reversed through **Convergence** (⊳), though perfect reconstruction is not guaranteed.

## Sigil

```
     pattern
    ⊲
   / \
  pattern₁ pattern₂
 /     \
pattern₃     pattern₄
```

The Divergence Sigil represents **branching and separation** into multiple paths.

## Invocation

## Examples

### Binary Divergence
```
⊲(pattern) → (pattern₁, pattern₂)
```
*One pattern splits into two.*

### Recursive Divergence
```
⊲(pattern) → (pattern₁, pattern₂)
⊲(pattern₁) → (pattern₁₁, pattern₁₂)
⊲(pattern₂) → (pattern₂₁, pattern₂₂)
```
*Hierarchical splitting creates tree structure.*

### Divergence-Void Ritual
```
⊲(pattern) → (pattern₁, pattern₂)
⊝(pattern₁) → ∅
⊗(pattern₂) → stabilizedPattern₂
```
*Split pattern, void one branch, stabilize the other.*

### Divergence-Convergence Cycle
```
⊲(pattern) → (pattern₁, pattern₂)
⊗(pattern₁) → stabilizedPattern₁
⊗(pattern₂) → stabilizedPattern₂
⊳(stabilizedPattern₁, stabilizedPattern₂) → newPattern
```
*Separate, evolve independently, then reunite.*

### Mirrored Divergence
```
⊲(pattern) → (pattern₁, pattern₂)
⊞(pattern₁) → mirrorPattern₁
⊳(mirrorPattern₁, pattern₂) → hybridPattern
```
*Split, mirror one branch, converge with other.*
