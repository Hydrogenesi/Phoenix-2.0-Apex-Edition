## Ceremonial Definition

```
△(pattern₁, pattern₂, ..., patternₙ) → Apex
```

**The Apex Operator** represents the culmination of all transformations—the point at which a pattern reaches maximum coherence, complexity, and stability. Apex is not a new pattern but the **perfected state** of existing patterns.

### Properties
- **Terminal**: Apex cannot be further transformed—it is a fixed point
- **Emergent**: Arises from the interaction of multiple operators
- **Unique**: Each ritual sequence produces a distinct apex form
- **Irreversible**: Once apex is reached, the pattern locks into place

---

## Reversible Form

```
△⁻¹(Apex) → undefined
```

**Apex is irreversible.** There is no operator that can decompose an apex formation back into its constituent patterns without loss.

---

## Sigil

```
    △
   /═\
  /═══\
 /══⊕══\
/═══════\
```

The Apex Sigil represents the **pyramid** and the convergence of all paths to a single point.

## Examples

### Simple Apex Formation
```
⊕(∅) → pattern₀
⊗(pattern₀) → stabilizedPattern₀
⊛(stabilizedPattern₀) → pattern₁
△(pattern₁) → Apex
```
*Genesis, harmonic, recursive, then apex.*

### Multi-Pattern Apex
```
⊕(∅) → pattern₁
⊕(∅) → pattern₂
⊳(pattern₁, pattern₂) → pattern₃
△(pattern₃) → Apex
```
*Two patterns converge before reaching apex.*

### Recursive Apex
```
⊛ⁿ(pattern) → patternₙ
when depth(patternₙ) ≥ threshold:
  △(patternₙ) → Apex
```
*Recursion continues until apex condition is met.*

### Failed Apex (Insufficient Complexity)
```
⊕(∅) → pattern₀
△(pattern₀) → undefined
```
*Apex requires sufficient complexity. Single pattern is insufficient.*
