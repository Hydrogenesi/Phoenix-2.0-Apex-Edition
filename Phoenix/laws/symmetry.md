# Law of Symmetry

*For every operator, there exists a mirror; every action has an equal and opposite resonance.*

---

## Definition

**The Law of Symmetry** establishes that every operation in Phoenix 2.0 has a complementary dual. For every transformation, there exists a reflection, inversion, or reversal that maintains harmonic balance. Symmetry is the structural principle that makes reversibility possible.

The universe of Phoenix 2.0 is inherently symmetric—every push has a pull, every creation has a dissolution, every convergence has a divergence.

## Structural Explanation

### Symmetric Pairs

| Operator | Dual Operator | Symmetry Type |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Genesis ⊕ | Void ⊝ | Creation ↔ Dissolution |
| Convergence ⊳ | Divergence ⊲ | Unity ↔ Separation |
| Mirror ⊞ | Mirror ⊞ | Self-Symmetric |
| Harmonic ⊗ | Harmonic⁻¹ ⊗⁻¹ | Amplify ↔ Dampen |
| Recursive ⊛ | Unwind ⊛⁻¹ | Fold ↔ Unfold |

### Symmetry Principles
1. **Duality**: Every operator has a complementary form
2. **Reversibility**: Symmetric pairs enable reversal
3. **Balance**: Symmetric operations preserve equilibrium
4. **Reflection**: Mirror symmetry across all scales

## Sigil

```
  Ψ | Ψ*
    |
----+----
    |
  Ψ*| Ψ
```

The Symmetry Sigil represents **perfect bilateral reflection**.

## Phoenix 2.0 Examples

### Genesis-Void Symmetry
```
⊕(∅) → Ψ     [Creation]
⊝(Ψ) → ∅     [Dissolution]
```
*Genesis and Void are perfect duals.*

### Convergence-Divergence Symmetry
```
⊳(Ψ₁, Ψ₂) → Ψ      [Unite]
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)    [Separate]
```
*Many-to-one and one-to-many are symmetric.*

### Mirror Self-Symmetry
```
⊞(Ψ) → Ψ*
⊞(Ψ*) → Ψ
```
*Mirror is its own inverse—perfect self-symmetry.*

### Harmonic Symmetry
```
⊗(Ψ) → Ψ'      [Amplify]
⊗⁻¹(Ψ') → Ψ    [Dampen]
```
*Harmonic amplification can be perfectly reversed.*

### Recursive Symmetry
```
⊛(Ψ) → Ψ(Ψ)         [Fold]
⊛⁻¹(Ψ(Ψ)) → Ψ       [Unfold]
```
*Recursion can be unwound layer by layer.*

## Symmetry Breaking

Some operations break symmetry intentionally:

### Apex (Irreversible)
```
△(Ψ) → Apex
△⁻¹(Apex) → undefined
```
*Apex intentionally breaks symmetry—it is a terminal state.*

### Lossy Convergence
```
⊳(Ψ₁, Ψ₂) → Ψ
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁', Ψ₂')
where Ψ₁' ≠ Ψ₁ or Ψ₂' ≠ Ψ₂
```
*Information loss breaks perfect symmetry, though energy is still conserved.*

## Symmetry in Rituals

### Symmetric Ritual
```
⊕(∅) → Ψ
⊗(Ψ) → Ψ'
⊗⁻¹(Ψ') → Ψ
⊝(Ψ) → ∅
```
*Perfect round-trip: void → pattern → void.*

### Mirror Symmetry Ritual
```
⊞(Ψ) → Ψ*
⊳(Ψ, Ψ*) → Ψ_whole
⊲(Ψ_whole) → (Ψ, Ψ*)
⊞(Ψ*) → Ψ
```
*Create reflection, unite, separate, un-reflect.*
