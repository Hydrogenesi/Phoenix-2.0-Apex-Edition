# Law of Conservation

*What is created must be accounted for; nothing emerges from void without trace.*

---

## Definition

**The Law of Conservation** states that the total harmonic energy in any Phoenix 2.0 system remains constant across all transformations. Energy and information are neither created nor destroyed—they are only transformed from one pattern to another.

Every operator, from Genesis to Void, must preserve the total energy budget. If a pattern is created, its energy comes from somewhere. If a pattern is dissolved, its energy goes somewhere.

## Structural Explanation

### Mathematical Expression
```
∑ E(Ψᵢ) = constant
```

Where E(Ψ) represents the harmonic energy of pattern Ψ.

### Conservation Across Operators

| Operator | Conservation Mechanism |
|----------|------------------------|
| Genesis ⊕ | Draws energy from void potential |
| Harmonic ⊗ | Redistributes without adding/removing |
| Recursive ⊛ | Energy compounds but total is constant |
| Apex △ | Locks energy in stable configuration |
| Void ⊝ | Returns energy to void potential |
| Mirror ⊞ | Perfect energy symmetry |
| Convergence ⊳ | Sums input energies |
| Divergence ⊲ | Divides energy among outputs |

### Key Principles
1. **Closed System**: Phoenix 2.0 operates in a closed harmonic system
2. **Transformation Only**: Operators transform, never create/destroy energy
3. **Reversibility**: Conservation enables operator reversibility
4. **Balance**: All rituals must balance their energy budget

## Sigil

```
    ∞
   /═\
  | E |
   \═/
    ∞
```

The Conservation Sigil represents the **eternal loop** of energy transformation.

## Phoenix 2.0 Examples

### Genesis-Void Cycle
```
⊕(∅) → Ψ    [Energy: ∅ → Ψ]
⊝(Ψ) → ∅    [Energy: Ψ → ∅]
Total: 0 = 0 ✓
```
*Energy drawn from void returns to void.*

### Divergence-Convergence Balance
```
Ψ has energy E
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)    [E → E₁ + E₂, where E = E₁ + E₂]
⊳(Ψ₁, Ψ₂) → Ψ'      [E₁ + E₂ → E']
Total: E = E' ✓
```
*Energy is conserved through split and merge.*

### Harmonic Amplification
```
⊗(Ψ) → Ψ'
Energy(Ψ) = Energy(Ψ')
```
*Harmonic stabilization doesn't add energy, just reorganizes it.*

### Recursive Conservation
```
⊛ⁿ(Ψ) has energy E
Each iteration reorganizes but preserves E
```
*Recursive depth doesn't create new energy.*

## Violations and Paradoxes

### Impossible Operation
```
⊕(∅) → Ψ
⊕(Ψ) → Ψ'
⊝(Ψ) → ∅
Final state: Ψ' exists without source
```
*This violates conservation—Ψ' has unaccounted energy.*

### Resolution
Use proper energy tracking:
```
⊕(∅) → Ψ     [Draw E₁ from void]
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)    [Split E₁ → E₁a + E₁b]
⊗(Ψ₁) → Ψ₁'         [Reorganize E₁a]
⊝(Ψ₂) → ∅          [Return E₁b to void]
```
*All energy is accounted for.*
