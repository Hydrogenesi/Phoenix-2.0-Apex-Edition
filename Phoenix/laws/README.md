# Substrate Laws

## Note on File Structure

The five substrate laws in this directory are **symlinks** to the canonical definitions located in `TheThird/Universal-Laws/substrate/`.

This refactoring eliminates code duplication while maintaining backward compatibility with all existing references to `Phoenix/laws/`.

### Why Symlinks?

The substrate laws (Conservation, Symmetry, Recursion, Emergence, and Duality) are fundamental to the entire Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition system. Rather than maintaining duplicate copies in both the Phoenix and TheThird engines, we maintain a single source of truth in the Universal Laws directory.

### The Five Substrate Laws

1. **[Law of Conservation](./conservation.md)** — Energy and information preservation
2. **[Law of Symmetry](./symmetry.md)** — Reversibility and balance
3. **[Law of Recursion](./recursion.md)** — Self-reference and infinite depth
4. **[Law of Emergence](./emergence.md)** — Complexity from simplicity
5. **[Law of Duality](./duality.md)** — Complementary opposites

All links above resolve to the canonical definitions in `../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/substrate/`.
