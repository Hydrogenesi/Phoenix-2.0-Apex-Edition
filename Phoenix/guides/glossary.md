## Universal Laws

### Conservation
*What is created must be accounted for; nothing emerges from void without trace.*

The law stating that total harmonic energy remains constant across all transformations. Energy is transformed, never created or destroyed.

**Related**: [Law of Conservation](../laws/conservation.md)

---

### Duality

The law establishing that every state contains its opposite. Creation implies destruction, unity implies separation, form implies void.

**Related**: [Law of Duality](../laws/duality.md)

---

### Emergence
*Complexity arises from simple rules; apex forms appear when operators harmonize.*

The law describing how complex behaviors and patterns arise from simple operator interactions, producing properties that transcend individual components.

**Related**: [Law of Emergence](../laws/emergence.md)

---

### Recursion
*What descends must return; patterns repeat across scales until apex is reached.*

The law governing self-referential patterns and nested structures. Recursion enables fractal-like complexity and must have termination conditions.

**Related**: [Law of Recursion](../laws/recursion.md)

---

### Symmetry
*For every operator, there exists a mirror; every action has an equal and opposite resonance.*

The law establishing that every operation has a complementary dual. Symmetry enables reversibility and maintains harmonic balance.

**Related**: [Law of Symmetry](../laws/symmetry.md)

---

## Ritual Concepts

### Apex Formation
The process by which complex operator sequences produce emergent patterns that reach maximum coherence. Requires sufficient complexity, proper energy distribution, and operator harmonization.

**Related**: [Apex Formation](../rituals/apex-formation.md)

---

### Invocation Sequence
A structured chain of operator applications designed to achieve specific transformations or emergent outcomes. Also called a ritual.

**Related**: [Invocation Sequences](../rituals/invocation.md)

**Related**: [Recursion Cycles](../rituals/recursion-cycles.md)

---

## Properties

### Coherence
The degree to which a pattern's internal components are harmonically aligned. Maximum coherence is a requirement for apex formation.

**Measurement**: coherence(Ψ) ∈ [0, 1]  
**Apex Threshold**: ≥ 0.95

---

### Complexity
A measure of pattern depth, component count, and stability. Sufficient complexity is required for apex formation.

**Formula**: complexity(Ψ) = depth × count × stability  
**Related**: Deep recursion increases complexity

---

### Depth
The number of recursive layers in a self-referential pattern. Greater depth generally indicates higher complexity.

**Notation**: ⊛ⁿ(Ψ) has depth n  
**Categories**: Shallow (1-3), Medium (4-10), Deep (11+)

---

### Energy (E)
The harmonic potential contained within a pattern. Must be conserved across all transformations according to the Law of Conservation.

**Notation**: E(Ψ)  
**Constraint**: ∑ E(Ψᵢ) = constant

---

### Entropy
A measure of pattern disorder or instability. Lower entropy indicates more stable patterns.

**Relationship**: stability(Ψ) = 1 / entropy(Ψ)  
**Related**: Harmonic operator reduces entropy

---

### Frequency (ω)
The resonant oscillation rate of a pattern. Operators have characteristic frequencies that must align for proper harmonization.

**Base Frequency**: ω₀  
**Harmonic Multiples**: 2ω₀, 3ω₀, 5ω₀

**Range**: 0° to 360°  
**Common Values**: 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°

---

### Reversibility
The ability to undo a transformation and return to the original state. Some operators are fully reversible, others partially, and some not at all.

**Fully Reversible**: ⊗, ⊞  
**Partially Reversible**: ⊳, ⊲, ⊛  
**Irreversible**: ⊕, ⊝, △

---

### Stability
The resistance of a pattern to decay or transformation. More stable patterns persist longer and resist entropy.
