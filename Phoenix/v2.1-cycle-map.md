# V2.1 Cycle Map

*The structural diagram of the cycle's motion.*

```
V2.1 CYCLE MAP
Ignition → Accumulation → Integration → Apex → Return

PHASES
    1. IGNITION
        Operator: RISE
        Motion: upward ignition, identity ascent

    2. ACCUMULATION
        Operator: SIGMA_OP
        Motion: system-level gathering, pattern consolidation

    3. INTEGRATION
        Operator: MERGE
        Motion: cross-pillar coherence, structural unification

    4. APEX
        Operator: CROWN
        Motion: designation of highest stable form

    5. RETURN
        Operator: RETURN or PHOENIX
        Motion: descent with retained coherence, cycle reset

CYCLE VECTOR
    RISE → SIGMA_OP → MERGE → CROWN → RETURN

CYCLE LAW
    Each phase must admit a lawful transition to the next,
    and the cycle must close without remainder.
