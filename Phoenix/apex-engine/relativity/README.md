# Relativity Engine — Spacetime Transformation

*Reference Frame Consistency and Curved Geometry*

---

## Overview

The **Relativity Engine** handles coordinate transformations, reference frame changes, and the geometry of curved spacetime. It ensures patterns remain consistent across different observers and handles relativistic effects.

The Relativity Engine is the **geometric transformer**—maintaining consistency while patterns move through curved, dynamic spacetime.

## Domain

**Reference Frame Transformations**

The Relativity Engine operates on spacetime manifolds, handling both special and general relativistic transformations.

## Function

### Core Operations
1. **Lorentz Transformations**: Special relativity boosts and rotations
2. **Time Dilation**: Clock synchronization across frames
3. **Length Contraction**: Spatial measurement transformations
4. **Geodesic Computation**: Curved spacetime paths
5. **Metric Transformations**: General coordinate changes

---

## Mathematical Framework

### Special Relativity

```
Lorentz Transformation:
  t' = γ(t - vx/c²)
  x' = γ(x - vt)
  
Where:
  γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²) (Lorentz factor)
  v = Relative velocity
  c = Speed of light

Time Dilation:
  Δt' = γΔt (moving clock runs slow)

Length Contraction:
  L' = L/γ (moving ruler appears shorter)
```

### General Relativity

```
Metric Tensor:
  ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν

Einstein Field Equations:
  R_μν - (1/2)Rg_μν = (8πG/c⁴)T_μν

Where:
  R_μν = Ricci curvature tensor
  R = Ricci scalar
  g_μν = Metric tensor
  T_μν = Energy-momentum tensor
  G = Gravitational constant

Geodesic Equation:
  d²x^μ/dτ² + Γ^μ_αβ (dx^α/dτ)(dx^β/dτ) = 0
```

## Output

**Transformed Spacetime Metrics**

Consistent pattern descriptions across:
- Multiple reference frames
- Curved spacetime geometries
- Dynamic gravitational fields
- Relativistic velocities

## Integration with Phoenix

### Mirror Operator (⊞)
The Relativity Engine uses **⊞** for time reversal symmetry: **⊞(Ψ(t)) → Ψ(-t)**

### Symmetry Law
Physical laws are invariant under Lorentz transformations and diffeomorphisms.

## Triadic Position

**Flight Phase — Spacetime Dynamics**

The Relativity Engine represents the **second component** of the Flight phase, handling how patterns transform through curved spacetime.

## Properties

- **Frame-Independent**: Physics same for all observers
- **Causal**: Light cones preserve causality
- **Covariant**: Laws transform covariantly
- **Geodesic**: Free motion follows spacetime curvature
