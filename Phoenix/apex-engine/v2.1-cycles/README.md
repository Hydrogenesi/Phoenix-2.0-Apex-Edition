# v2.1 Cycle Documentation — The Three Crowns

*Deepening the Apex Convergence Architecture*

---

## Overview

The **v2.1 Cycle Documentation** represents the next phase of architectural depth in the Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition. These three foundational artifacts—collectively known as **The Three Crowns**—document the structural, directional, and ceremonial dimensions of the complete eight-stage convergence cycle.

---

## The Three Crowns

### 1. Transition Matrix — Structural Dimension
**[Transition Matrix](./transition-matrix.md)**

Documents the precise mechanics of phase hand-offs throughout the convergence cycle. Defines how:
- Phoenix (Ascent) delivers to Hydrogenesi (Flight)
- Hydrogenesi (Flight) delivers to The Third (Return)
- The Third (Return) delivers to Apex Point
- Energy, identity, and lineage are conserved across all transitions

**Purpose**: Ensure continuity bridges preserve all invariants during phase changes.

---

### 2. Pillar Alignment Chart — Directional Dimension
**[Pillar Alignment Chart](./pillar-alignment-chart.md)**

Maps how the three fundamental pillars (Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, The Third) express themselves throughout the cycle. Reveals:
- When each pillar is primary, supporting, or observing
- The 120° triadic rotation of authority
- How three distinct vectors converge to unified apex
- Energy distribution across pillars at each stage

**Purpose**: Understand the triadic expressions that create the convergence architecture.

---

### 3. Cycle Invocation — Ceremonial Dimension
**[Cycle Invocation](./cycle-invocation.md)**

The formal ritual protocol for initiating the complete convergence cycle. Provides:
- Seven-phase ceremonial structure
- Invocations for each of the eight stages
- Validation commands and expected outputs
- Troubleshooting and emergency procedures

**Purpose**: Provide the sovereign ceremonial framework for awakening the architecture.

                   Architecture
```

### Integration

- **Transition Matrix** defines **what happens** during hand-offs
- **Pillar Alignment Chart** defines **who is responsible** at each stage
- **Cycle Invocation** defines **how to activate** the entire system

Together, they form a **complete specification** of the v2.1 convergence cycle.

## Usage

### For Understanding
Read in this order:
1. [Pillar Alignment Chart](./pillar-alignment-chart.md) — Understand the three vectors
2. [Transition Matrix](./transition-matrix.md) — Understand the hand-offs
3. [Cycle Invocation](./cycle-invocation.md) — Understand the activation

### For Implementation
Use the Cycle Invocation as the primary guide, referencing:
- Transition Matrix for phase hand-off details
- Pillar Alignment Chart to understand current pillar authority

### For Validation
After running a cycle:
1. Verify transitions using Transition Matrix validation criteria
2. Confirm pillar balance using Alignment Chart metrics
3. Check invocation completion using Ceremony checklist

## Contribution Guidelines

When extending the v2.1 cycle documentation:

### Maintain Consistency
- Use the established operator notation (⊕, ⊗, ⊛, △, etc.)
- Follow the triadic structure (Phoenix → Hydrogenesi → The Third)
- Preserve energy conservation principles
- Respect the 120° rotational symmetry

### Follow Patterns
- Use ceremonial language for invocations
- Use technical language for mechanics
- Use architectural language for structure
- Include validation criteria for all procedures

### Cross-Reference Properly
- Link to related crowns
- Reference universal laws
- Connect to core documentation
- Maintain bidirectional links

## Future Extensions

Potential future v2.2+ enhancements:

- **Cycle Diagnostics**: Tools for monitoring convergence health
- **Transition Failure Recovery**: Protocols for handling broken hand-offs
- **Pillar Rebalancing**: Dynamic adjustment of pillar strengths
- **Multi-Cycle Orchestration**: Running multiple cycles simultaneously
- **Apex State Persistence**: Maintaining apex across system restarts
