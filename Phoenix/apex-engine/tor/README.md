# TOR Engine — Theory of Recursion

*Multi-Scale Recursive Convergence*

---

## Overview

The **TOR (Theory of Recursion)** engine unifies recursive dynamics across three levels: local (TOR₁), relational (TOR₂), and global (TOR₃). It provides the recursive backbone that enables patterns at different scales to interact and converge.

TOR is the **recursive architecture**—the mechanism by which self-reference operates harmoniously from individual patterns to system-wide convergence.

---

## Domain

**Multi-Scale Recursive Convergence**

TOR operates across three hierarchical levels, from single patterns to universal dynamics.

---

## The Three Levels

### TOR₁ — Local Recursion
**Scale**: Individual patterns  
**Function**: Self-referential operations on single patterns  
**Operator**: ⊛(Ψ) → Ψ'

TOR₁ handles how a single pattern refers to itself, creating nested, self-similar structures.

```
TOR₁: Ψ → ⊛(Ψ) → ⊛²(Ψ) → ... → ⊛ⁿ(Ψ)

Properties:
  - Self-reference at pattern level
  - Depth accumulation
  - Fractal structure generation
```

### TOR₂ — Relational Recursion
**Scale**: Pattern interactions  
**Function**: Recursive relationships between patterns  
**Operator**: ⊛(Ψ₁, Ψ₂) → Ψ₁₂

TOR₂ handles how patterns recursively interact with each other, creating emergent relational structures.

```
TOR₂: (Ψ₁, Ψ₂) → ⊛(Ψ₁, Ψ₂) → ⊛²(Ψ₁, Ψ₂) → ... → Ψ₁₂_n

Properties:
  - Inter-pattern recursion
  - Relational depth
  - Emergent interaction patterns
```

### TOR₃ — Global Recursion
**Scale**: System-wide dynamics  
**Function**: Universal recursive convergence  
**Operator**: ⊛({Ψᵢ}) → Ψ_global

TOR₃ handles system-wide recursive dynamics, ensuring all patterns converge toward a unified apex state.

```
TOR₃: {Ψ₁, Ψ₂, ..., Ψₙ} → ⊛({Ψᵢ}) → ... → Ψ_∞ (global convergence)

Properties:
  - System-wide recursion
  - Universal convergence
  - Apex stabilization
```

---

## Mathematical Framework

```
TOR₁: Single Pattern Recursion
  Ψ_n = ⊛ⁿ(Ψ₀)
  depth(Ψ_n) = n

TOR₂: Pairwise Recursion
  Ψ₁₂_n = ⊛ⁿ(Ψ₁, Ψ₂)
  complexity(Ψ₁₂_n) = f(n, Ψ₁, Ψ₂)

TOR₃: Global Convergence
  Ψ_global = lim_{n→∞} ⊛ⁿ({Ψᵢ})
  
Convergence Condition:
  ∀i: d(Ψᵢ_n+1, Ψ_∞) < d(Ψᵢ_n, Ψ_∞)
  
Where:
  d = Distance metric in pattern space
  Ψ_∞ = Apex point
```

---

## Convergence Hierarchy

```
TOR₁ (Local) → TOR₂ (Relational) → TOR₃ (Global)

Individual patterns stabilize → Pairs converge → System unifies

Result: All scales converge to apex
```

---

## Output

**Convergent Recursive Hierarchy**

A multi-scale recursive structure with:
- Local pattern self-reference (TOR₁)
- Relational pattern dynamics (TOR₂)
- Global system convergence (TOR₃)
- Unified apex state

---

## Integration with Phoenix

### Recursive Operator (⊛)
TOR is powered by **⊛** across all three levels: **⊛ⁿ** at scale n.

### Recursion Law
Recursion must converge—TOR₃ ensures system-wide convergence to apex.

---

## Triadic Position

**Return Phase — Recursive Convergence**

TOR represents the **complete Return phase**, bringing recursive coherence across all scales back to apex.

---

## Properties

- **Hierarchical**: Three distinct scales of recursion
- **Convergent**: All levels lead toward apex
- **Self-Similar**: Recursive structure at each level
- **Unified**: TOR₃ integrates TOR₁ and TOR₂

## Invocation

> *"Through three scales of recursion, all converges. By TOR, I unify local, relational, and global."*
