# FLQG₁ Engine — Foundational Quantum Geometry

*The Discrete Fabric of Spacetime*

---

## Overview

The **FLQG₁ (Fractal Loop Quantum Gravity — Foundation)** engine establishes the fundamental quantum geometry of spacetime. It provides the discrete lattice structure upon which all higher-order phenomena emerge.

FLQG₁ is the **substrate**—the primordial geometric foundation that replaces continuous spacetime with a discrete, quantized network of loops.

## Domain

**Quantum Spacetime Structure**

FLQG₁ operates at the Planck scale (~10⁻³⁵ m), where spacetime becomes discrete and granular.

---

## Function

### Core Operations
1. **Lattice Initialization**: Creates discrete spacetime network
2. **Loop Formation**: Establishes quantum spin network nodes
3. **Geometric Quantization**: Discretizes area and volume operators
4. **Substrate Stabilization**: Maintains foundational coherence

---

## Mathematical Framework

```
FLQG₁: ∅ → L₀

Where:
  ∅ = Void (pre-geometric state)
  L₀ = Initial loop network (spin network)

Operators:
  γ = Immirzi parameter (dimensionless coupling)
  A_j = Area operator (quantized in Planck units)
  V_j = Volume operator (quantized in Planck units)
```

### Quantization Rules

```
Area: A = 8πγℓₚ² ∑ √(j(j+1))
Volume: V = ∑ V_node(j₁, j₂, j₃, ...)

Where:
  ℓₚ = Planck length (1.616 × 10⁻³⁵ m)
  j = Spin quantum number
```

## Output

**Quantum Geometry Foundation**

A discrete spin network representing quantized spacetime geometry with:
- Quantized area and volume
- Discrete topological structure
- Stable geometric substrate

## Integration with Phoenix

### Genesis Operator (⊕)
FLQG₁ begins with **⊕(∅) → L₀**, creating the first loop network from void.

### Conservation Law
Total geometric degrees of freedom are conserved across all FLQG₁ transformations.

## Triadic Position

**Ascent Phase — Quantum Foundation**

FLQG₁ represents the **first step** in the Ascent phase, establishing the geometric substrate upon which FLQG₂ builds recursive structures.

---

## Properties

- **Discrete**: Spacetime is quantized, not continuous
- **Loop-Based**: Fundamental units are quantum loops
- **Background-Independent**: No external spacetime required
- **Diffeomorphism-Invariant**: Coordinate-independent formulation
