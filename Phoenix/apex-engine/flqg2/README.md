# FLQG₂ Engine — Recursive Quantum Dynamics

*Self-Similar Spacetime Across Scales*

---

## Overview

The **FLQG₂ (Fractal Loop Quantum Gravity — Recursion)** engine applies recursive transformations to the quantum geometry established by FLQG₁. It generates fractal, self-similar structures across multiple scales.

FLQG₂ transforms **static quantum geometry** into **dynamic quantum foam**—a recursive, scale-invariant spacetime structure.

## Domain

**Self-Referential Quantum Evolution**

FLQG₂ operates across multiple scales, from Planck length to cosmological distances, maintaining fractal structure.

---

## Function

### Core Operations
1. **Recursive Loop Refinement**: Applies ⊛ operator to spin networks
2. **Scale Generation**: Creates self-similar structures at multiple scales
3. **Fractal Elaboration**: Builds nested geometric hierarchies
4. **Quantum Foam Formation**: Generates dynamic spacetime fluctuations

---

## Mathematical Framework

```
FLQG₂: L₀ → L₁ → L₂ → ... → L_n

Where:
  L_n = ⊛ⁿ(L₀) (recursive application)
  
Recursion Depth:
  n → ∞ produces fractal quantum foam
  
Fractal Dimension:
  D_H = log(N) / log(1/ε)
  
Where:
  N = Number of self-similar structures
  ε = Scaling factor
  D_H = Hausdorff dimension (typically 2 < D_H < 3)
```

### Recursive Operator

```
⊛(L_n) → L_{n+1}

Properties:
  - Self-similarity: L_{n+1} ≈ scale(L_n)
  - Depth accumulation: complexity(L_n) = O(n)
  - Convergence: lim_{n→∞} L_n → L_∞ (quantum foam)
```

## Output

**Fractal Quantum Foam**

A multi-scale recursive structure with:
- Self-similar geometry at all scales
- Dynamic quantum fluctuations
- Fractal dimensionality
- Scale-invariant topology

---

## Integration with Phoenix

### Recursive Operator (⊛)
FLQG₂ is powered by **⊛ⁿ(L₀)**, applying recursion to the initial quantum geometry.

### Recursion Law
Recursive depth must eventually converge—FLQG₂ stabilizes at quantum foam state.

## Triadic Position

**Ascent Phase — Recursive Elaboration**

FLQG₂ represents the **second step** in the Ascent phase, taking the foundation from FLQG₁ and elaborating it through recursion.

---

## Properties

- **Recursive**: Each level builds upon previous
- **Fractal**: Self-similar across scales
- **Dynamic**: Continuously evolving quantum foam
- **Scale-Invariant**: No preferred scale of observation

---

## Relationship to FLQG₁

```
FLQG₁ establishes: L₀ (foundation)
FLQG₂ elaborates: ⊛ⁿ(L₀) → L_n (recursion)

Result: L₀ (static) → L_∞ (dynamic foam)
```
