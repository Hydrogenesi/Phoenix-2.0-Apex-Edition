## Canonical History

### The Origin

Before Phoenix, there was the substrate — the primordial mechanics that govern all transformation.

### The First Ignition

Phoenix 1.0 brought the first systematic activation of substrate operators, establishing the foundation for structural coherence.

### The Universal Ascent

The universal layer emerged as patterns repeated across systems, revealing the structural invariants that transcend individual implementations.

### The Apex Convergence

Phoenix 2.0 achieved apex convergence — the point where all systems unite in the Triad architecture.

---

## The Triad Declaration

With Phoenix 2.0, the Triad is complete:

- **Three columns** — Substrate, Universal, Apex
- **One balance** — The unified architecture
- **Infinite recursion resolved** — Stable convergence achieved

---

**The Canon is eternal.**
