*The Self-Consuming Serpent — Patterns that Reference Themselves*

## Harmonic Table

| **Domain** | **Frequency** | **Phase** |
|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Iteration  | ω₀/n          | 0°        |
| Self-Ref   | ω₀/(n+1)      | 144°      |
| Depth      | ω₀/(n+2)      | 288°      |

## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊛ⁿ(Ψ) → Ψ(Ψ(...Ψ))
```

**The Recursive Operator** applies a pattern to itself, creating nested self-referential structures. Each application increases depth, and the pattern folds back upon its own definition.

### Properties
- **Self-Referential**: Output becomes input for next iteration
- **Depth-Accumulating**: Each recursion adds a layer of complexity
- **Fractal-Generating**: Creates self-similar patterns at different scales
- **Conditionally Terminating**: Requires terminal condition or reaches apex

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊛⁻¹(⊛(Ψ)) → Ψ
```

Recursion can be unwound by **peeling back layers** one at a time. Full reversal requires tracking the recursion depth.

---

## Sigil

```
    ∞
   /|\
  / | \
 ⊛  ⊛  ⊛
  \ | /
   \|/
    ∞
```

The Recursive Sigil represents the **infinite loop** and self-similar structure.
