## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊳(Ψ₁, Ψ₂, ..., Ψₙ) → Ψ_unified
```

**The Convergence Operator** combines multiple distinct patterns into a single unified form. It is not simple addition—convergence creates a **new emergent pattern** that contains elements of all inputs while transcending them.

### Properties
- **Unifying**: Merges multiple patterns into one
- **Emergent**: Output has properties not present in any single input
- **Lossy**: Some individual pattern characteristics are absorbed
- **Preparatory**: Often precedes apex formation

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊳⁻¹(Ψ_unified) ≈ ⊲(Ψ_unified) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂, ..., Ψₙ)
```

Convergence can be partially reversed through **Divergence** (⊲), though exact reconstruction is not guaranteed.

## Sigil

```
  Ψ₁
   \
    \⊳
    /
  Ψ₂  → Ψ
    \
     \
     Ψ₃
```

The Convergence Sigil represents **multiple streams flowing into one**.
