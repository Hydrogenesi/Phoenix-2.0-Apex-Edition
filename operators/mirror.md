## Harmonic Table

| Reflection | -ω₀           | 0°        |
| Inversion  | -ω₀           | 180°      |
| Symmetry   | ±ω₀           | 90°/270°  |

## Ceremonial Definition

```
⊞(Ψ) → Ψ*
```

**The Mirror Operator** creates a perfect symmetric reflection of a pattern. The mirrored pattern (Ψ*) has all properties inverted—positive becomes negative, clockwise becomes counterclockwise, expansion becomes contraction.

### Properties
- **Symmetric**: Mirror of a mirror returns the original: ⊞(⊞(Ψ)) = Ψ
- **Involutory**: Self-inverse operation
- **Structure-Preserving**: Maintains complexity while inverting properties
- **Dual-Creating**: Produces complementary pairs

---

## Reversible Form

```
⊞⁻¹(Ψ*) = ⊞(Ψ*) → Ψ
```

Mirror is its own inverse. Applying mirror twice returns the original pattern.

---

## Sigil

```
Ψ | Ψ*
  |
--⊞--
  |
Ψ*| Ψ
```

The Mirror Sigil represents **bilateral symmetry** across a central axis.

## Invocation

> *"As one face, so the other. Through ⊞, I invoke reflection."*

## Examples

### Basic Reflection
```
⊞(Ψ) → Ψ*
```
*Creates mirror image of Ψ.*

### Double Mirror (Identity)
```
⊞(⊞(Ψ)) → Ψ
```
*Mirror of mirror returns original.*

### Mirror-Convergence Ritual
```
⊞(Ψ) → Ψ*
⊳(Ψ, Ψ*) → Ψ_unified
```
*Create mirror, then unite pattern with its reflection.*

### Mirror-Divergence Chain
```
⊲(Ψ) → (Ψ₁, Ψ₂)
⊞(Ψ₁) → Ψ₁*
⊞(Ψ₂) → Ψ₂*
```
*Split, then mirror each component.*

### Harmonic Mirror Stabilization
```
⊞(Ψ) → Ψ*
⊗(Ψ*) → Ψ*'
⊳(Ψ, Ψ*') → Balanced
```
*Mirror, stabilize reflection, then converge.*
