# Apex Continuity

**Apex Layer — Triad Canon**

---

## Principle

*At the apex, all patterns converge into unity.*  
*Continuity is the signature of completion.*

---

## The Law

In the apex layer, **continuity** ensures:

- All transformations connect seamlessly
- No discontinuities exist at convergence
- The architecture achieves smooth totality

---

## Operator

```
ApexContinuity(structure) → continuous_convergence
```

Where all gaps close and unity emerges.

---

## Applications

- Seamless convergence
- Gap resolution
- Unified architecture
