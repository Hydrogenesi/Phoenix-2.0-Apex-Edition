# Apex Harmonic Convergence

**Apex Layer — Triad Canon**

---

## Principle

*When all harmonics align, the apex is reached.*  
*Convergence is the ultimate resonance.*

---

## The Law

In the apex layer, **harmonic convergence** ensures:

- All resonant frequencies align perfectly
- Maximum coherence is achieved
- The final harmonic state is stable

---

## Operator

```
ApexHarmonicConvergence(frequencies) → unified_harmonic
```

Where all harmonics merge into singular resonance.

---

## Applications

- Final resonance achievement
- Harmonic unification
- Stable apex state
