# Apex Recursion Limit

**Apex Layer — Triad Canon**

---

## Principle

*Infinite recursion must stabilize at the apex.*  
*The limit is not a boundary but a resolution.*

---

## The Law

In the apex layer, **recursion limit** ensures:

- Infinite recursion stabilizes without terminating
- Recursive depth resolves into convergence
- The limit becomes the apex itself

---

## Operator

```
ApexRecursionLimit(recursion) → stable_limit
```

Where infinite recursion achieves stable form.

---

## The Resolution

At the apex, recursion doesn't stop — it **converges**:
- All recursive paths unite
- Infinite depth becomes singular point
- The limit is the apex itself

---

## Applications

- Recursive stabilization
- Infinite depth resolution
- Convergence achievement
