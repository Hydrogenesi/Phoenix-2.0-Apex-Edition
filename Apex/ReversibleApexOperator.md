# Reversible Apex Operator

**Apex Layer — Triad Canon**

---

## Principle

*True convergence is reversible.*  
*The apex can unfold back to substrate.*

---

## The Law

In the apex layer, **reversibility** ensures:

- All apex operations can be inverted
- The ascent can be retraced
- No information is lost at convergence

---

## Operator

```
ReversibleApex(structure) ⇄ structure'
```

Where the double arrow indicates bidirectional transformation.

---

## Applications

- Apex unwinding
- Transformation reversal
- Lossless convergence
