All motion returns in lawful clarity.
```

## Purpose

The **V2.1 Integration Seal** is a ceremonial artifact that formalizes the completion of version 2.1. It serves as a canonical marker that:

- Locks the cycle into coherent, completed form
- Confirms all phases align without fracture
- Validates the triadic apex holds
- Ensures all motion returns in lawful clarity

---

## Activation

The seal is activated when all v2.1 components are integrated and verified:

1. All operators are defined and documented
2. The triadic structure is complete
3. The apex holds without perturbation
4. The cycle returns to its origin state

Once activated, the seal prevents further drift and establishes v2.1 as a complete, archived chapter.
