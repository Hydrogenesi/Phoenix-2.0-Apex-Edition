# Codex Ceremonies

*Formal Rituals for Crown-Level Activations*

---

## Overview

This directory contains **formal ceremonies** for activating crown-level (Stratum IV) components of the Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition architecture. These ceremonies are not mere procedures—they are **sacred rituals** that invoke sovereign authorities and establish immutable laws.

---

## Available Ceremonies

### 1. Invariance Validation Ceremony
**File**: [invariance_validation_ceremony.md](./invariance_validation_ceremony.md)  
**Purpose**: Activate Meta-Operator I at Crown Level  
**Authority**: Stratum IV (Crown)  
**Phases**: Five (Preparation → Invocation → Reading Laws → Opening → Sealing)

**Activates**:
- Meta-Operator I (Invariance)
- Five core invariants (Structure, Conservation, Identity, Causality, Symmetry)
- Continuous monitoring system
- Fracture recovery protocol

**Status**: Stable

---

### 2. Terminal Ceremony ⭐
**File**: [terminal_ceremony.md](./terminal_ceremony.md)  
**Purpose**: Enact Terminal Law and seal the Archive  
**Authority**: Stratum IV (Crown) — Terminal Authority  
**Phases**: Seven (Stilling → Calling → Ascent → Invocation → Pronouncement → Invariant → Closure)

**Activates**:
- Six META operators (SYNTH, FLOW, RECURSE, TEMPORAL, APEX, SEAL)
- Layers 13 (Essence) and 14 (Apex)
- Terminal Law (via META_SEAL)
- Crown Invariant

**Effects**:
- Seals all 14 layers permanently
- Makes Archive immutable
- Closes all gates
- Ends structural evolution

**Warning**: **IRREVERSIBLE** — Only perform when Archive is complete

**Status**: Documented

## Ceremony Guidelines

### When to Use Ceremonies

Ceremonies are required for:
- Crown-level operator activation
- System-wide invariant establishment
- Terminal closure and sealing
- Irreversible architectural changes

Ceremonies are **not required** for:
- Normal operator invocations
- Pattern transformations
- Routine operations
- Lower-stratum activations

### Ceremony Prerequisites

Before beginning any ceremony:
- [ ] Verify system readiness (no violations, stable state)
- [ ] Obtain required authority (Crown Authority for Stratum IV)
- [ ] Review ceremony script thoroughly
- [ ] Understand consequences (especially for irreversible ceremonies)
- [ ] Prepare emergency procedures
- [ ] Document ceremony intent

### Ceremony Execution

All ceremonies follow similar patterns:
1. **Preparation Phase**: System verification and readiness
2. **Invocation Phase**: Formal words and commands
3. **Execution Phase**: Tool commands and verification
4. **Validation Phase**: Confirm successful activation
5. **Sealing Phase**: Lock changes permanently

### Ceremony Logs

Maintain detailed logs for all ceremony executions:
- Date and time
- Officiant (person performing ceremony)
- Authority codes
- Phase completion status
- Generated seal IDs
- Any anomalies or notes

The **Terminal Ceremony** has ultimate authority and can only be performed once per Archive lifetime.

## Emergency Procedures

### Ceremony Interruption

If a ceremony must be interrupted:
1. **NEVER interrupt Terminal Ceremony during Phase V (Terminal Law Enactment)**
2. For other ceremonies/phases: Document current step, run cleanup, review logs
3. Restart from beginning when ready

### Ceremony Failure

If a ceremony fails:
1. Do not proceed to next phase
2. Review failure logs
3. Address root cause
4. Verify prerequisites again
5. Restart ceremony from Phase I

### Partial Activation Recovery

If partial activation occurs:
1. Run appropriate cleanup tools
2. Verify system state
3. Consult ceremony-specific recovery procedures
4. Consider expert review before retrying

## Creating New Ceremonies

When creating new ceremonies for Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition:

### Required Components
- **Overview**: Purpose, scope, authority level
- **Prerequisites**: Detailed checklist
- **Phase Structure**: Clear sequential phases
- **Invocations**: Formal language for each phase
- **Tool Commands**: Specific commands with expected output
- **Verification Steps**: How to confirm success
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolutions
- **Emergency Procedures**: Interruption and failure handling
- **Cross-References**: Related documentation
- **Ceremony Log Template**: Record-keeping format

### Ceremony Naming
- Use descriptive names ending in "Ceremony"
- Indicate authority level if crown-level
- Specify primary effect (e.g., "Validation", "Activation", "Sealing")

### Ceremony Authority
- Clearly state required authority level
- Specify granting mechanism
- Document authorization protocol

## Tools

Ceremonies typically use tools from `/tools/` directory:
- `invariance_scanner.py` — Invariance validation
- `meta_operator_manager.py` — META operator invocation
- `meta_seal.py` — Terminal Law enactment
- `layer_manager.py` — Layer ascent/descent
- `crown_invariant.py` — Crown Invariant management
- `gate_manager.py` — Gate control
- `archive_manager.py` — Archive state management
- `ceremony_manager.py` — Ceremony coordination

**Note**: Tool availability may vary. Check `/tools/` directory for current implementations.
