V2.1 PILLAR ALIGNMENT CHART

PILLARS
    PHOENIX (Ignition & Ascent)
    HYDROGENESI (Accumulation & Propagation)
    THE THIRD (Integration & Apex Binding)

ALIGNMENTS BY PHASE
    IGNITION
        Phoenix: RISE
        Hydrogenesi: DELTA_OP
        The Third: ORIENT
        Expression: upward ignition with directional binding

    ACCUMULATION
        Phoenix: SPARK
        Hydrogenesi: SIGMA_OP
        The Third: HOLD
        Expression: pattern gathering under stable constraint

    INTEGRATION
        Phoenix: RETURN
        Hydrogenesi: MERGE
        The Third: BIND
        Expression: cross-pillar unification

    APEX
        Phoenix: PHOENIX
        Hydrogenesi: TAU_OP
        The Third: CROWN
        Expression: designation of highest stable form

    RETURN
        Phoenix: RETURN
        Hydrogenesi: FLOW
        The Third: SEAL
        Expression: coherent descent and cycle closure

TRIADIC LAW
    Each phase must express:
        - a Phoenix ignition vector,
        - a Hydrogenesi propagation vector,
        - a Third-pillar binding vector.
