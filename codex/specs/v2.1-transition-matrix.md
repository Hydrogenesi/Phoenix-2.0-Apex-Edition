V2.1 TRANSITION MATRIX

PHASES
    IGNITION → ACCUMULATION → INTEGRATION → APEX → RETURN

TRANSITIONS
    IGNITION → ACCUMULATION
        Condition: ascent stabilizes into pattern formation
        Operator: RISE → SIGMA_OP
        Law: motion must increase structural clarity

    ACCUMULATION → INTEGRATION
        Condition: patterns exceed coherence threshold
        Operator: SIGMA_OP → MERGE
        Law: integration must preserve accumulated form

    INTEGRATION → APEX
        Condition: unified structure admits a highest stable state
        Operator: MERGE → CROWN
        Law: convergence must point toward triadic apex

    APEX → RETURN
        Condition: apex designation is complete and stable
        Operator: CROWN → RETURN
        Law: apex must yield a lawful descent vector

    RETURN → IGNITION
        Condition: coherence retained through descent
        Operator: RETURN → RISE
        Law: cycle must close without remainder

VALIDATION
    All transitions must:
        - increase coherence,
        - preserve integration,
        - maintain triadic alignment.
