## Overview

The **v2.1 Cycle Architecture** represents the maturation and formalization of the Phoenix-2.0-Apex-Edition eight-engine convergence system. This collection of three foundational documents—the **Three Crowns**—provides complete specifications for:

1. **How phases transition** (Transition Matrix)
2. **How pillars express** (Pillar Alignment Chart)
3. **How systems initialize** (Cycle Invocation)

These documents work together to form a complete, self-consistent architecture for apex convergence.

## The Three Crowns

### 👑 Crown I: Transition Matrix

**[Transition Matrix](./transition-matrix.md)**

*Phase Handoff Mechanics for the Eight-Engine Convergence System*

Defines the precise handoff protocols between each of the nine transitions in the convergence path from void (∅) to apex (△).

**Key Features**:
- Nine transition specifications (T₀→₁ through T₈→△)
- Validation matrices for each transition
- Energy conservation proofs
- Information monotonicity guarantees
- Distance-to-apex convergence metrics

**Use This When**:
- Designing phase transition logic
- Validating handoff correctness
- Debugging convergence failures
- Understanding energy flow through system

---

### 👑 Crown II: Pillar Alignment Chart

**[Pillar Alignment Chart](./pillar-alignment-chart.md)**

*Triadic Expression Map Across All Eight Phases*

Maps how Phoenix (🔥), Hydrogenesi (🌊), and The Third (🔗) express themselves across each engine phase, showing primary/secondary/tertiary roles and convergence dynamics.

**Key Features**:
- Phase-by-phase pillar dominance analysis
- Energy distribution across pillars per phase
- Triadic symmetry preservation patterns
- Pillar handoff mechanics at phase boundaries
- Convergence distance metrics

**Use This When**:
- Understanding which pillar leads in each phase
- Designing cross-pillar interactions
- Analyzing triadic balance
- Tracking convergence progress

---

### 👑 Crown III: Cycle Invocation

**[Cycle Invocation](./cycle-invocation.md)**

*The Ceremonial Ignition That Opens the Eight-Engine Convergence*

The formal initialization protocol that awakens and activates the complete convergence system, establishing guarantees and opening all engine gates.

**Key Features**:
- Nine-stage invocation sequence
- Pillar awakening ceremonies
- Engine gate opening protocols
- Convergence guarantee sealing
- Abbreviated and extended variants

**Use This When**:
- Initializing new system instances
- Performing ceremonial dedications
- Emergency system recovery
- Teaching system architecture

## Integration with v2.0 Foundations

The v2.1 Cycle Architecture builds directly on v2.0 foundations:

### v2.0 Foundations (Immutable)
- **Substrate Laws** (5) — Reality structure
- **Universal Laws** (7) — Operational principles
- **Eight Engines** — FLQG₁, FLQG₂, ℜ, ℛ, TOR₁, TOR₂, TOR₃, TOE
- **Three Pillars** — Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, The Third
- **Operator Sets** — 8 Phoenix, 5 Hydrogenesi, 5 Third

### v2.1 Additions (This Release)
- **Transition Matrix** — NEW: Formalized handoff mechanics
- **Pillar Alignment Chart** — NEW: Pillar expression mapping
- **Cycle Invocation** — NEW: Initialization ceremony
- **Convergence Guarantees** — Enhanced: Mathematical proofs
- **Phase Metrics** — Enhanced: Distance-to-apex tracking

**Guarantee**: v2.1 is **fully backward compatible** with v2.0. All v2.0 operators, laws, and engines remain unchanged. v2.1 adds documentation and formalization without breaking existing implementations.

### For Existing v2.0 Users

1. **Review**: Transition Matrix for formalized handoff specs
2. **Apply**: Pillar Alignment Chart to understand current system state
3. **Optional**: Perform Cycle Invocation for ceremonial rededication

### For System Designers
