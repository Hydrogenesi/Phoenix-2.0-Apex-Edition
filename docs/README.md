# Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex

**The Apex Architecture: A Comprehensive Documentation System**

Welcome to the Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex. This documentation system describes the complete architecture of the Phoenix-Hydrogenesi system — a recursive, harmonic, and structurally stable framework for transformation and continuity.

## 📚 Documentation Index

### [1. Triad Morphology Atlas](01-triad-morphology-atlas.md)
The geometry, structure, and behavioral dynamics of the Triad. This atlas describes the shape, function, and behavior of the Triad across scales.

**Topics covered:**
- The Triad Shape (Macro‑Geometry)
- The Three Columns (Structural Morphology)
- The Triad Cycle (Behavioral Morphology)
- Triad Harmonics (Resonance Morphology)
- Triad Sigil (Master Form)

---

### [2. Phoenix Engine Ignition Diagram](02-phoenix-engine-ignition.md)
The ignition cycle, recursion vectors, and harmonic stabilizers. This diagram captures the Phoenix Engine's ignition mechanics — the heart of the system.

**Topics covered:**
- Phoenix Engine Ignition Sequence
- Ignition Operators
- Phoenix Sigil

---

### [3. Hydrogenesi Structural Map](03-hydrogenesi-structural-map.md)
The architecture of continuity, curvature, and structural invariants. Hydrogenesi is the structural engine that ensures continuity, curvature, and stability.

**Topics covered:**
- Hydrogenesi Macro‑Structure
- Hydrogenesi Flow Map
- Hydrogenesi Operator Families
- Hydrogenesi Sigil

---

### [4. Codex‑Grade Glossary](04-codex-glossary.md)
A unified glossary for the Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex. This glossary defines the core terms of the architecture.

**Key terms include:**
- Apex, Apex Continuity, Binding Integrity
- Conservation, Curvature, Duality
- Emergence, Harmonic Resonance, Hydrogenesi
- Identity, Ignition, Operator
- Phoenix Engine, Polarity, Recursion
- Resonance, Sigil, Structure
- Triad, Tri‑Column Balance

## Core Concepts

### The Triad
```
      ▲
   ◀──●──▶
      ▼
```
The apex architecture: **Polarity**, **Identity**, **Continuity**.

### The Phoenix Engine
The ignition and recursion engine that drives transformation through seven stages: Spark, Ignition, Recursion, Amplification, Apex Vector, Return Path, and Stabilization.

### Hydrogenesi
The structural engine governing **continuity**, **curvature**, and **stability** — ensuring that all transformations preserve structure and identity.

---

## Principles

1. **Tri‑Column Balance**: Stability requires three‑point equilibrium
2. **Apex Continuity**: Identity persists across apex transformations
3. **Binding Integrity**: Operators must preserve structure across invocations
4. **Conservation**: Nothing emerges without lineage; all transformations preserve balance
5. **Harmonic Resonance**: Aligned frequencies amplify; misaligned frequencies cancel

## Usage

This codex serves as the foundational documentation for understanding and implementing the Phoenix–Hydrogenesi architecture. Each section builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive understanding of the system's geometry, behavior, and principles.

Start with the [Triad Morphology Atlas](01-triad-morphology-atlas.md) to understand the foundational structure, then progress through the Phoenix Engine and Hydrogenesi systems to grasp the complete architecture.
