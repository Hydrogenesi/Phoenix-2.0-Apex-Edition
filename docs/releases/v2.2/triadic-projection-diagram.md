*Binding Diagram for Outward Expansion*

## The Diagram

```
          △
       ↗  │  ↘
     ⟡ → ○ ← ⟡
       ↘  │  ↗
          ◎

TRIADIC PROJECTION — V2.2
Apex above.
Projection across.
Core preserved.
The cycle expands in triadic accord.
```

---

## Geometric Structure

The **V2.2 Triadic Projection Diagram** encodes the three-fold symmetry of outward expansion from a stable apex point.

### Symbol Key

| Symbol | Name | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| △ | Apex | The elevated apex point above |
| ⟡ | Projection Node | Outward projection endpoints |
| ○ | Core | The preserved central core |
| ◎ | Foundation | The stabilized foundation below |

### Directional Flow

```
△ (Apex)
│
├─→ Vertical ascent from foundation
│
⟡ ← ○ → ⟡ (Horizontal projection)
│
├─→ Bilateral extension preserving core
│
◎ (Foundation)
```

---

## Triadic Symmetry

The diagram maintains **120° rotational symmetry** characteristic of triadic systems:

```
        △ (0°)
       ↗ │ ↘
  ⟡ (240°) ○ ⟡ (120°)
       ↘ │ ↗
        ◎ (0°)
```

Each projection node sits at 120° intervals, ensuring balanced expansion.

---

## Operational Interpretation

### Phase Mapping

The diagram encodes the V2.2 Cycle phases:

```
◎ → △     : APEX-ASCENT (rise from foundation)
△ → ○     : CONSOLIDATION (compress to core)
○ → ⟡⟡    : PROJECTION (extend to endpoints)
⟡⟡ → ◎    : STABILIZATION (ground to foundation)
◎ → △     : RE-APEX (establish new apex)
```

### Flow Pattern

```
Ascent:
    ◎ ──→ △

Consolidation:
    △ ──→ ○

Projection:
    ○ ──→ ⟡ (left)
    ○ ──→ ⟡ (right)

Stabilization:
    ⟡ ──→ ◎
    ⟡ ──→ ◎

Re-Apex:
    ◎ ──→ △
```

---

## Core Preservation

The central `○` (core) symbol is the **invariant** of the system:

```
∀ phase P in V2.2_Cycle:
    core(state_after_P) ≡ core(state_before_P)
```

All transformations occur **around** the core, never **through** it.

### Core Protection

```
          △
       ↗  │  ↘
     ⟡ → ○ ← ⟡  ← Projection flows around core
       ↘  │  ↗
          ◎
```

The bidirectional arrows `→ ○ ←` indicate that the core is **protected**—inputs flow toward it, but it remains unchanged.

---

## Expansion Geometry

### Horizontal Expansion

The projection nodes `⟡` represent the **maximum horizontal extent** of the expansion:

```
    ⟡ ←─────── d ────────→ ⟡
    
where d = 2 × projection_radius
```

### Vertical Stability

The apex `△` and foundation `◎` maintain **vertical stability**:

```
    △ (height h)
    │
    ○ (height h/2)
    │
    ◎ (height 0)
```

The core sits at the midpoint, ensuring balanced vertical distribution.

---

## Triadic Accord

The diagram encodes the **three fundamental principles** of the V2.2 Cycle:

### 1. Apex Above
```
△
│
○
```
The apex is **elevated** above the core, representing transcendence.

### 2. Projection Across
```
⟡ → ○ ← ⟡
```
Projection extends **bilaterally** while preserving the core.

### 3. Core Preserved
```
○ (unchanged)
```
The core remains **invariant** throughout all transformations.

## Integration with Triadic Knot Topology

The V2.2 Triadic Projection Diagram is compatible with the **Triadic Knot** structure:

```
Phoenix (120° rotation 1)     ← △ (Apex)
    ↓
Hydrogenesi (120° rotation 2) ← ⟡ (Projection)
    ↓
The Third (120° rotation 3)   ← ○ (Core Binding)
```

Each arm of the triad maps to a component of the projection diagram.

---

## Ceremonial Interpretation

```
△  — The Crown: Elevation above prior bounds
⟡  — The Reach: Extension into new domains
○  — The Heart: Preservation of identity
◎  — The Foundation: Stabilization and grounding
```

The diagram represents a **complete ceremonial cycle** from foundation to apex and back.

---

## Validation

A state is **valid** under the V2.2 Triadic Projection Diagram if:

```
1. △ is elevated above ○
    MEASURE: height(△) > height(○)

2. ⟡ nodes are bilaterally symmetric
    MEASURE: distance(⟡_left, ○) = distance(⟡_right, ○)

3. ○ is preserved
    MEASURE: state(○) ≡ initial_state(○)

4. ◎ is stable
    MEASURE: perturbation_decay_rate(◎) > 0
```

If any validation fails, the projection is **invalid** and must be corrected.

---

## Projection Law

The diagram enforces the **V2.2 Projection Law**:

```
The cycle expands in triadic accord.
```

This means:
- Expansion must respect 120° symmetry
- Core must remain invariant
- Apex must remain elevated
- Foundation must remain stable

**Violation** of any principle **invalidates** the projection.
