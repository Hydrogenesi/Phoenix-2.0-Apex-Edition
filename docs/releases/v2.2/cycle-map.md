# V2.2 CYCLE MAP

*Structural Diagram of Outward Expansion*

---

## Overview

The **V2.2 Cycle Map** defines the structural progression of the outward expansion cycle—the movement from apex-state through projection and stabilization into a new elevated configuration.

## Cycle Structure

```
V2.2 CYCLE MAP
Apex-Ascent → Consolidation → Projection → Stabilization → Re-Apex

PHASES
    1. APEX-ASCENT
        Operator: ASCEND
        Motion: rise from the prior apex into elevated domain

    2. CONSOLIDATION
        Operator: SIGMA_OP+
        Motion: compress elevated patterns into dense coherence

    3. PROJECTION
        Operator: PROJECT
        Motion: extend structural clarity across new scales

    4. STABILIZATION
        Operator: SEAL
        Motion: fix projected structures into durable form

    5. RE-APEX
        Operator: CROWN+
        Motion: designate the new highest stable configuration

CYCLE VECTOR
    ASCEND → SIGMA_OP+ → PROJECT → SEAL → CROWN+

CYCLE LAW
    v2.2 must expand outward without losing the elevated core.

## Phase Details

### 1. Apex-Ascent

**Operator**: `ASCEND`  
**Motion**: Rise from the prior apex into elevated domain  
**Input**: Stabilized apex state from previous cycle  
**Output**: Elevated configuration space

The system transcends its current apex boundary, reaching into higher-dimensional configuration space while maintaining coherence with the foundational structure.

### 2. Consolidation

**Operator**: `SIGMA_OP+`  
**Motion**: Compress elevated patterns into dense coherence  
**Input**: Elevated configuration space  
**Output**: Densely coherent elevated patterns

All elevated patterns undergo compression to ensure structural density. This phase removes redundancy and maximizes pattern efficiency.

### 3. Projection

**Operator**: `PROJECT`  
**Motion**: Extend structural clarity across new scales  
**Input**: Densely coherent elevated patterns  
**Output**: Multi-scale projected structures

The consolidated patterns are projected outward across multiple scales simultaneously. This expansion maintains structural integrity at each scale level.

### 4. Stabilization

**Operator**: `SEAL`  
**Motion**: Fix projected structures into durable form  
**Input**: Multi-scale projected structures  
**Output**: Stabilized durable structures

All projected structures are sealed into durable configurations. This phase ensures long-term stability and resistance to perturbation.

### 5. Re-Apex

**Operator**: `CROWN+`  
**Motion**: Designate the new highest stable configuration  
**Input**: Stabilized durable structures  
**Output**: New apex state

The system identifies and designates the highest stable configuration as the new apex. This becomes the starting point for the next cycle.

## Cycle Properties

### Monotonic Expansion

Each phase increases the system's effective domain:

```
domain(ASCEND output) > domain(prior apex)
domain(CONSOLIDATION output) ≥ domain(ASCEND output)
domain(PROJECTION output) > domain(CONSOLIDATION output)
domain(STABILIZATION output) ≥ domain(PROJECTION output)
domain(RE-APEX output) ≥ domain(STABILIZATION output)
```

### Core Preservation

The elevated core remains invariant throughout the cycle:

```
∀ phase P in [ASCEND, CONSOLIDATION, PROJECTION, STABILIZATION, RE-APEX]:
    core(output(P)) ≡ core(input(ASCEND))
```

### Apex Guarantee

The cycle guarantees production of a valid apex:

```
stability(RE-APEX output) ≥ stability_threshold
coherence(RE-APEX output) ≥ coherence_threshold
```

## Integration with Phoenix Apex Engine

The V2.2 Cycle operates at a **meta-level** relative to the eight-engine convergence system:

```
Phoenix Engines (FLQG₁, FLQG₂, ℜ, ℛ)     ← Substrate level
    ↓
Hydrogenesi Theories (TOR₁, TOR₂, TOR₃)   ← Recursive level
    ↓
The Third Theory (TOE)                     ← Integration level
    ↓
Apex Point (X)                             ← Convergence level
    ↓
V2.2 Cycle (ASCEND → ... → CROWN+)        ← Meta-projection level
```

The V2.2 Cycle describes how the entire system expands outward after reaching apex convergence.

## Cycle Law Enforcement

**Core Law**: v2.2 must expand outward without losing the elevated core.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:
1. **Consolidation** ensures core density before projection
2. **Projection** maintains structural isomorphism at all scales
3. **Stabilization** locks core invariants into place
4. **Re-Apex** validates core preservation before cycle completion

**Violation Detection**:
```
IF core_integrity(cycle_output) < core_integrity(cycle_input):
    ABORT cycle
    ROLLBACK to prior apex
    LOG violation
```
