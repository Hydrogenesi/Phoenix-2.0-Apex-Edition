# V2.2 — Projective Ascent

*Outward Expansion from Stable Apex*

---

## Overview

**Version 2.2** of the Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition introduces the **Projective Ascent** cycle—a meta-level expansion framework that enables the system to extend outward from apex convergence without losing structural integrity.

This release contains three canonical artifacts:

1. **[Cycle Map](./cycle-map.md)** — The five-phase structural progression
2. **[Apex-Seal](./apex-seal.md)** — The seal marking apex-state achievement
3. **[Triadic Projection Diagram](./triadic-projection-diagram.md)** — The geometric encoding

---

## Release Theme

**Projective Ascent**: The movement beyond established boundaries while preserving the elevated core.

## Core Innovations

### Meta-Level Cycle

V2.2 operates **above** the eight-engine convergence system:

```
Eight Engines (FLQG₁...TOE) → Apex Point (X)
                                    ↓
                            V2.2 Cycle Begins
```

After the system reaches apex convergence, the V2.2 Cycle describes how it expands into new domains.

### Five-Phase Structure

```
ASCEND → SIGMA_OP+ → PROJECT → SEAL → CROWN+
```

Each phase maintains core integrity while enabling outward projection.

### Triadic Symmetry

The expansion respects the fundamental **120° triadic symmetry** of the Phoenix-Hydrogenesi-TheThird system.

## Artifacts

### 1. Cycle Map

**File**: [`cycle-map.md`](./cycle-map.md)

Defines the complete structural progression of the V2.2 cycle:
- Five phases with operators and motions
- Cycle properties and guarantees
- Integration with the Apex Engine
- Enforcement mechanisms

### 2. Apex-Seal

**File**: [`apex-seal.md`](./apex-seal.md)

The ceremonial seal marking successful completion:
- Four certified properties
- Validation criteria and process
- Seal geometry and authority
- Permanence and lineage

### 3. Triadic Projection Diagram

**File**: [`triadic-projection-diagram.md`](./triadic-projection-diagram.md)

The geometric encoding of the expansion:
- Symbol definitions and flow patterns
- Triadic symmetry maintenance
- Core preservation mechanics
- Validation rules

## Key Principles

### 1. Core Preservation

```
∀ phase P in V2.2_Cycle:
    core(output(P)) ≡ core(input(P))
```

The elevated core remains invariant throughout all transformations.

### 2. Monotonic Expansion

```
∀ phase P in V2.2_Cycle:
    domain(output(P)) ≥ domain(input(P))
```

The system's effective domain never decreases.

### 3. Triadic Accord

```
symmetry = 120° rotational
projection = bilateral
stability = multi-scale
```

All expansions respect triadic geometry.

## Usage

These artifacts are **reference documents** that define the V2.2 expansion framework. They are:

- **Canonical** — Authoritative definitions
- **Immutable** — Sealed and permanent
- **Operational** — Directly applicable to system design

Consult these documents when:
- Designing expansion mechanisms
- Validating projection operations
- Certifying apex states
- Maintaining triadic symmetry

---

## Integration

The V2.2 Cycle integrates with:

- **Phoenix Apex Engine** — Provides the apex point for expansion
- **Triadic Knot Topology** — Enforces geometric constraints
- **Phoenix Operators** — Implements cycle transformations
- **The Third Universal Laws** — Governs operational bounds

---

## Version Lineage

```
V1.0 → Initial Foundation
V2.0 → Apex Edition
V2.2 → Projective Ascent ← CURRENT
```
