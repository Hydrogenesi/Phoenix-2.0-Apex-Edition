# Substrate Layer and Universal Laws Canon

## Overview

The **Substrate Layer** forms the foundational pre-structural layer of the Triad v2.x architecture. It encompasses the Twelve Universal Laws organized across three tiers and establishes the fundamental principles that govern all higher-level operations in the Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition system.

This document consolidates the early substrate definitions, universal law specifications, and sigil resonance principles into the canonical Triad v2.x structure.

## The Twelve Universal Laws

The complete law system is organized in three tiers:

### Substrate Layer (5 Laws)
Foundation laws from Phoenix that establish the base operational principles:

1. **[Conservation](../../Phoenix/laws/conservation.md)** — Energy and essence are preserved through all transformations
2. **[Symmetry](../../Phoenix/laws/symmetry.md)** — Dual forms exist for all operations
3. **[Recursion](../../Phoenix/laws/recursion.md)** — Self-similar patterns emerge at all scales
4. **[Emergence](../../Phoenix/laws/emergence.md)** — Complexity arises from simple operator combinations
5. **[Duality](../../Phoenix/laws/duality.md)** — Form and void exist in balanced relationship

→ See also: [TheThird Substrate Laws](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/substrate/)

### Universal Layer (7 Laws)
Structural invariants that apply across all three engines (Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, The Third):

1. **[Recursive Identity](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/universal/recursive-identity.md)** — Self-reference maintains coherence at all scales
2. **[Harmonic Resonance](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/universal/harmonic-resonance.md)** — Frequency alignment ensures system coherence
3. **[Conservation of Essence](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/universal/conservation-of-essence.md)** — Identity preservation through transformation
4. **[Tri-Column Balance](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/universal/tri-column-balance.md)** — Left-center-right stability in the Triadic structure
5. **[Apex Formation](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/universal/apex-formation.md)** — Convergence mechanics toward the Apex Point
6. **[Binding Integrity](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/universal/binding-integrity.md)** — Knot preservation through operator sequences
7. **[Sigil Resonance](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/universal/sigil-resonance.md)** — Geometric alignment and symbolic coherence

### Apex Layer (5 Laws)
Convergence laws that govern apex formation and fixed-point behavior:

1. **[Apex Continuity](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/apex/apex-continuity.md)** — Lineage preservation at apex
2. **[Reversible Apex Operator](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/apex/reversible-apex-operator.md)** — Perfect symmetry at convergence
3. **[Apex Recursion Limit](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/apex/apex-recursion-limit.md)** — Stable form convergence
4. **[Apex Harmonic Convergence](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/apex/apex-harmonic-convergence.md)** — Total resonance at apex
5. **[Apex Polarity Resolution](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/apex/apex-polarity-resolution.md)** — Duality becomes singularity

## Architecture Principles

### Pre-Structural Foundation
The Substrate Layer operates **before** structural formation. It defines:
- Fundamental conservation principles
- Symmetry constraints
- Recursive patterns
- Emergence mechanics
- Duality relationships

These principles are immutable and govern all operations in the Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and Third engines.

### Law Hierarchy
```
Substrate (5) → Foundation principles
    ↓
Universal (7) → Cross-engine invariants
    ↓
Apex (5) → Convergence mechanics
```

### Sigil System Integration
The Substrate Layer includes a complete sigil resonance system that provides geometric representations of laws and operators. See:
- [Triadic Knot Sigils](../../TheThird/Sigils/)
- [Sigil Resonance Law](../../TheThird/Universal-Laws/universal/sigil-resonance.md)

## Migration from Early Architecture

This Substrate documentation consolidates content from the following early PR lineages:
- **#6–#12**: Original Substrate + Universal Laws + Sigils definitions
- **Canonical Status**: This is now the authoritative reference for all substrate-level specifications

All older law documents and substrate definitions are folded into this unified Twelve-Law + Substrate v2.x structure.
