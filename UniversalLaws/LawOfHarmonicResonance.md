# Law of Harmonic Resonance

**Universal Layer — Structural Invariants**

---

## Principle

*Structures that resonate together cohere.*  
*Harmony is the pattern of aligned vibration.*

---

## The Law

In the universal layer, **harmonic resonance** ensures:

- Compatible structures align naturally
- Resonance amplifies coherence
- Harmony emerges from aligned frequencies

---

## Operator

```
Resonate(x, y) → harmonize(x, y)
```

Where compatible structures achieve resonant harmony.

---

## Applications

- Structure alignment
- Coherence amplification
- Harmonic stabilization
