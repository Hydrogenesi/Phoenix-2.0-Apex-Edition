# Law of Apex Formation

**Universal Layer — Structural Invariants**

---

## Principle

*From structured coherence emerges the apex.*  
*The path to convergence is through formation.*

---

## The Law

In the universal layer, **apex formation** enables:

- Preparation for apex convergence
- Structural readiness for final unification
- The pathway from universal to apex layer

---

## Operator

```
ConvergeApex(structure) → apex_ready
```

Where the structure is prepared for apex-layer operations.

---

## Applications

- Apex transition preparation
- Convergence readiness verification
- Layer boundary crossing
