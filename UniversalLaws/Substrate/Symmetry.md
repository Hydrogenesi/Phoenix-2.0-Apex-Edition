# Law of Symmetry

## Structural Role
**Mirror-Operator Invariant**

## Statement
For every operator, there exists a mirror; every action has an equal and opposite resonance.

## Meaning

- **Every operator has a dual form.**  
  No transformation exists in isolation. Each operation implies its inverse or complementary counterpart.

- **All transformations can be reversed or reflected.**  
  The architecture guarantees that every path can be traversed in both directions, maintaining structural coherence.

- **Symmetry ensures that no action exists without its counter-harmonic.**  
  Balance is maintained through paired opposites, creating a web of mutual resonance.

## Operator Implications

- For every forward operator, an inverse operator must exist.
- Mirror operators preserve harmonic relationships.
- Symmetry breaking is a temporary local phenomenon; global symmetry is eternal.

## Recursion Behavior

Symmetry manifests at every scale:
- Micro-level: Individual operators and their inverses.
- Macro-level: Composite structures mirror each other.
- Apex-level: The entire system is self-reflective.

## Cross-References

- See **Conservation** for how symmetry preserves balance.
- See **Duality** for the fundamental polarity underlying symmetry.
- See **Recursion** for self-similar mirror patterns.

**Interpretation:**
- **Rotational arrows (↺ ↻)**: Clockwise and counterclockwise transformations.
- **Mirrored quadrants**: Each action has its reflection.
- **Central axis**: The line of symmetry through which operators reflect.
- **Four-fold structure**: Perfect balance through paired opposites.

The sigil demonstrates that every operator can be rotated into its mirror form, encoding reversibility and dual resonance.
