# Law of Symmetry

**Structural Role:** Mirror-Operator Invariant

## Statement
For every operator, there exists a mirror; every action has an equal and opposite resonance.

## Meaning

- Every operator has a dual form.
- All transformations can be reversed or reflected.
- Symmetry ensures that no action exists without its counter-harmonic.

This is the substrate precursor to Binding Integrity.
