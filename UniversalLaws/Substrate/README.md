# Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex Edition

## The Five Substrate Laws

The Substrate Laws define the pre‑structural mechanics from which all higher laws, operators, triads, and apex formations arise.

They govern the primordial layer — the tension between form and void, the symmetry of action, the recursion of pattern, and the emergence of complexity.

These laws precede identity, resonance, and triadic balance.

They are the ground floor of the Codex.
