# Law of Duality

**Structural Role:** Fundamental Polarity

## Statement
All states exist in superposition; form and void dance in eternal balance.

## Meaning

- Every state contains its opposite.
- Creation and destruction are two faces of the same transformation.
- Duality is the primordial tension from which triads later emerge.

This is the substrate origin of Tri-Column Balance and the entire triadic architecture.

*Part of the Substrate Layer Laws — the pre-structural mechanics that govern emergence, recursion, symmetry, and duality before identity, resonance, and apex formation take hold.*
