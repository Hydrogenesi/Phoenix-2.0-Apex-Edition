# Law of Duality

## Structural Role
**Fundamental Polarity**

## Statement
All states exist in superposition; form and void dance in eternal balance.

## Meaning

- **Every state contains its opposite.**  
  No pure state exists. All manifestations carry within them the seed of their negation.

- **Creation and destruction are two faces of the same transformation.**  
  What appears as birth is also death; what seems like ending is also beginning. These are not separate processes but unified transformations viewed from different perspectives.

- **Duality is the primordial tension from which triads later emerge.**  
  The fundamental polarity between form and void is the substrate from which all higher-order structures arise.

## Operator Implications

- All operators encode both creation and destruction.
- States exist in superposition until observed/resolved.
- Duality is not conflict but complementary unity.

## Recursion Behavior

Duality manifests at all recursive depths:
- Micro-level: Individual operators contain dual nature.
- Macro-level: Systems oscillate between polar states.
- Apex-level: Perfect balance — form and void in eternal equilibrium.

## Cross-References

- See **Symmetry** for how duality expresses through mirrors.
- See **Emergence** for how duality generates complexity through tension.
- See **Conservation** for how duality maintains balance.

## Sigil

```
   ╭───────╮
   │  ◐◑   │
   │  ⇆    │
   │  ◑◐   │
   ╰───────╯
```

**Interpretation:**
- **Half-moons (◐◑)**: Form and void — complementary opposites.
- **Bidirectional arrow (⇆)**: Eternal exchange between polarities.
- **Mirrored arrangement**: Upper and lower halves reflect and invert.
- **Contained infinity**: The cycle continues endlessly within bounds.

The sigil embodies superposition: light and dark, being and non-being, creation and destruction existing simultaneously in dynamic equilibrium.
