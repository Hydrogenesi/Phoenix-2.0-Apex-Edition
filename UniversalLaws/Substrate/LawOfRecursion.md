# Law of Recursion

**Substrate Layer — Primordial Mechanics**

---

## Principle

*A pattern that contains itself is eternal.*  
*Recursion is the engine of infinite structure.*

---

## The Law

In the substrate layer, **recursion** is the operator that enables:

- Self-referential structures
- Infinite depth with finite definition
- Pattern replication across scales

---

## Operator

```
Recurse(x) → Recurse(Recurse(x))
```

Where each recursion maintains structural coherence.

---

## Applications

- Fractal generation
- Self-similarity enforcement
- Infinite depth construction
