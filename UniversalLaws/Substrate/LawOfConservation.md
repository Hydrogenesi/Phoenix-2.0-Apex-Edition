# Law of Conservation

**Substrate Layer — Primordial Mechanics**

---

## Principle

*That which is created cannot be destroyed.*  
*That which exists must be preserved.*

---

## The Law

In the substrate layer, **conservation** is the fundamental operator that ensures:

- No information is lost
- No structure is destroyed without transformation
- All operations preserve the essential nature of the substrate

---

## Operator

```
Conserve(x) → x'
```

Where `x'` maintains the fundamental properties of `x` across all transformations.

---

## Applications

- Substrate identity preservation
- Transformation tracking
- State continuity
