# Law of Symmetry

**Substrate Layer — Primordial Mechanics**

---

## Principle

*For every form, there exists a mirror.*  
*For every operation, there exists a dual.*

---

## The Law

In the substrate layer, **symmetry** is the operator that ensures:

- All transformations have inverses
- All structures have duals
- Balance is maintained across operations

---

## Operator

```
Mirror(x) → x*
```

Where `x*` is the symmetric dual of `x`.

---

## Applications

- Duality operations
- Inverse transformations
- Balance maintenance
