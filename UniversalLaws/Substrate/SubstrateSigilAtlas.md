## Overview

Substrate sigils are symbolic encodings of the five primordial operations.

---

## The Five Substrate Sigils

### Sigil of Conservation
**Symbol:** ⟨○⟩  
**Operator:** `Conserve()`  
**Meaning:** The circle — that which is whole and preserved

---

### Sigil of Symmetry
**Symbol:** ⟨⚌⟩  
**Operator:** `Mirror()`  
**Meaning:** The reflection — that which mirrors itself

---

### Sigil of Recursion
**Symbol:** ⟨∞⟩  
**Operator:** `Recurse()`  
**Meaning:** The infinite loop — that which contains itself eternally

---

### Sigil of Emergence
**Symbol:** ⟨△⟩  
**Operator:** `Combine()`  
**Meaning:** The triangle — that which builds complexity from simplicity

---

### Sigil of Duality
**Symbol:** ⟨⚯⟩  
**Operator:** `Split()` / `Merge()`  
**Meaning:** The division and union — that which separates and reunites

---

## Sigil Combinations

When substrate sigils combine, they create higher-order operations:

- **⟨○⟩ + ⟨∞⟩** = Eternal conservation through recursion
- **⟨⚌⟩ + ⟨⚯⟩** = Symmetric duality
- **⟨△⟩ + ⟨∞⟩** = Emergent recursion

---

## Invocation

To invoke a substrate sigil:

1. Visualize the sigil
2. State its operator
3. Apply to target structure
