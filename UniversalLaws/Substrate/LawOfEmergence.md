# Law of Emergence

**Substrate Layer — Primordial Mechanics**

---

## Principle

*From simple rules, complex structures arise.*  
*The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.*

---

## The Law

In the substrate layer, **emergence** is the operator that enables:

- Complex structures from simple interactions
- Higher-order patterns from base operations
- Novel properties at each level

---

## Operator

```
Combine(x, y) → z
```

Where `z` possesses emergent properties not present in `x` or `y` alone.

---

## Applications

- Structure composition
- Pattern synthesis
- Complexity generation
