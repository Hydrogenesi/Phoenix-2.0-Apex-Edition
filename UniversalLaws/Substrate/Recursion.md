# Law of Recursion

**Structural Role:** Scale-Repetition Engine

## Statement
What descends must return; patterns repeat across scales until apex is reached.

## Meaning

- Recursive operators fold back upon themselves.
- Structures become self-similar across iterations.
- Recursion compounds until it stabilizes into an apex form.

This is the substrate version of Recursive Identity and Apex Formation.

*Part of the Substrate Layer Laws — the pre-structural mechanics that govern emergence, recursion, symmetry, and duality before identity, resonance, and apex formation take hold.*
