# Law of Recursion

## Structural Role
**Scale-Repetition Engine**

## Statement
What descends must return; patterns repeat across scales until apex is reached.

## Meaning

- **Recursive operators fold back upon themselves.**  
  Operations are self-referential, creating feedback loops that generate depth and complexity.

- **Structures become self-similar across iterations.**  
  Each level of recursion mirrors the pattern of levels above and below, creating fractal coherence.

- **Recursion compounds until it stabilizes into an apex form.**  
  Iteration continues until a resonant equilibrium is achieved — the apex state.

## Operator Implications

- Operators can take themselves as input.
- Self-similarity is preserved across recursive depth.
- Termination occurs at apex convergence, not arbitrary limits.

## Recursion Behavior

Recursion is the law's own mechanism:
- **Base case**: Simple operators with minimal recursion.
- **Recursive case**: Operators that invoke themselves with transformed parameters.
- **Apex case**: Convergence to a stable, resonant form.

## Cross-References

## Sigil

**Interpretation:**
- **Central circle (○)**: The recursive core — the pattern that repeats.
- **Surrounding arrows (↻)**: Recursive invocations folding inward and outward.
- **Four-fold recursion**: Self-similarity at each cardinal direction.
- **No beginning or end**: The circle repeats infinitely.

The sigil embodies infinite self-reference: the outer patterns fold into the center, which in turn generates the outer patterns.
