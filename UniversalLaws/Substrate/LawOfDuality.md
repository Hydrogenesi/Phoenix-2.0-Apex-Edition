# Law of Duality

**Substrate Layer — Primordial Mechanics**

---

## Principle

*All structure contains its opposite.*  
*Unity arises from duality.*

---

## The Law

In the substrate layer, **duality** is the operator that ensures:

- Every structure has complementary aspects
- Opposition creates coherence
- Unity emerges from balanced duality

---

## Operators

```
Split(x) → (x₁, x₂)
Merge(x₁, x₂) → x
```

Where splitting and merging preserve total structure.

---

## Applications

- Polarity management
- Complementary structure generation
- Unity through opposition
