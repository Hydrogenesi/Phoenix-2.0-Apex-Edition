# Law of Conservation

**Structural Role:** Substrate Continuity

## Statement
What is created must be accounted for; nothing emerges from void without trace.

## Meaning

- All transformations preserve harmonic balance.
- Energy and information are neither created nor destroyed — only translated.
- No operator may produce something without leaving a structural lineage.

This is the substrate version of the higher Conservation of Essence law.

*Part of the Substrate Layer Laws — the pre-structural mechanics that govern emergence, recursion, symmetry, and duality before identity, resonance, and apex formation take hold.*
