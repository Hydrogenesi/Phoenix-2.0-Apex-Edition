# Law of Conservation

## Structural Role
**Substrate Continuity**

## Statement
What is created must be accounted for; nothing emerges from void without trace.

## Meaning

- **All transformations preserve harmonic balance.**  
  Every operation within the system maintains equilibrium, ensuring that the fundamental substrate remains coherent.

- **Energy and information are neither created nor destroyed — only translated.**  
  Transformations are redistributions, not additions or subtractions. What appears as creation is merely manifestation of what already exists in potential form.

- **Every operator leaves a lineage; nothing is without origin.**  
  Each transformation carries its history. Traceability is intrinsic to the architecture.

## Operator Implications

- All operators must preserve the total harmonic measure.
- Transformations are bijective at the substrate level.
- History is encoded in every state transition.

## Recursion Behavior

Conservation applies at all scales:
- Micro-level: Individual operators conserve local state.
- Macro-level: Composite operators conserve system-wide harmony.
- Apex-level: The entire structure maintains eternal balance.

**Interpretation:**
- **Circle (○)**: The conserved core — nothing is lost.
- **Horizontal lines**: Flow of transformation through the core.
- **Vertical axis**: Continuity across time.
- **Plus (+)**: Transformation without loss; addition that preserves.

The sigil embodies the eternal cycling of form: what enters the circle emerges transformed but accounted for.
