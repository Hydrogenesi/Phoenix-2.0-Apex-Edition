# Law of Emergence

**Structural Role:** Complexity Genesis

## Statement
Complexity arises from simple rules; apex forms appear when operators harmonize.

## Meaning

- Simple operators, when sequenced, produce emergent behavior.
- Emergence is not additive — it is harmonic.
- Apex forms are the natural consequence of aligned operators.

This is the substrate precursor to Harmonic Resonance.

*Part of the Substrate Layer Laws — the pre-structural mechanics that govern emergence, recursion, symmetry, and duality before identity, resonance, and apex formation take hold.*
