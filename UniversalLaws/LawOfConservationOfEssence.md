# Law of Conservation of Essence

**Universal Layer — Structural Invariants**

---

## Principle

*The essence of structure is eternal.*  
*What is fundamental cannot be lost.*

---

## The Law

In the universal layer, **conservation of essence** ensures:

- Core identity persists through all transformations
- Fundamental properties remain invariant
- The essential nature is preserved across operations

---

## Operator

```
PreserveEssence(x) → essence(x)
```

Where `essence(x)` is the invariant core that persists through all changes.

---

## Applications

- Identity preservation
- Core property maintenance
- Essence extraction and verification
