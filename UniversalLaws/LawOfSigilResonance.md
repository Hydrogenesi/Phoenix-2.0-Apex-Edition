# Law of Sigil Resonance

**Universal Layer — Structural Invariants**

---

## Principle

*Symbols carry power when they resonate.*  
*Sigils are operators encoded.*

---

## The Law

In the universal layer, **sigil resonance** enables:

- Symbolic operation execution
- Pattern-based transformations
- Resonant symbolic effects

---

## Operator

```
SigilOperate(sigil) → effect
```

Where the sigil encodes and executes a specific operation.

---

## Sigil Types

- **Substrate Sigils** — Encode primordial operations
- **Universal Sigils** — Encode structural transformations
- **Apex Sigils** — Encode convergence operations

---

## Applications

- Symbolic programming
- Pattern-based execution
- Resonant invocation
