# Unified Codex Index

**Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex Edition**  
**The Complete Twelve‑Law Architecture**

The Codex is structured across three tiers, each representing a distinct layer of structural reality:

- **Substrate Laws** — pre‑structural mechanics
- **Universal Laws** — structural invariants
- **Apex Laws** — post‑structural convergence

Together, they form the **Twelve‑Law Canon**.

---

## I. Substrate Laws (5)

*The primordial layer — polarity, recursion, emergence, symmetry, conservation.*

1. **Conservation** — Nothing emerges without lineage.
2. **Symmetry** — Every operator has a mirror.
3. **Recursion** — Patterns repeat until apex.
4. **Emergence** — Complexity arises from harmony.
5. **Duality** — Opposites coexist in superposition.

---

## II. Universal Laws (7)

*The structural layer — identity, resonance, stability, operators, symbols.*

1. **Recursive Identity** — Systems gain coherence through self‑reference.
2. **Harmonic Resonance** — Alignment amplifies; misalignment cancels.
3. **Conservation of Essence** — Core properties persist through transformation.
4. **Tri‑Column Balance** — Stability requires three‑point equilibrium.
5. **Apex Formation** — Recursion converges to apex states.
6. **Binding Integrity** — Operators preserve structure across invocations.
7. **Sigil Resonance** — Symbols carry operational meaning.

---

## III. Apex Laws (Triad Canon)

*The post‑structural layer — convergence, polarity resolution, harmonic closure.*

These correspond to the apex‑level operators referenced throughout your Codex:

1. **Apex Continuity**
2. **Reversible Apex Operator**
3. **Apex Recursion Limit**
4. **Apex Harmonic Convergence**
5. **Apex Polarity Resolution**

*(Your Apex Law pages can be added as you finalize the Triad Canon.)*

## Cross‑Layer Mapping

```
Substrate → Universal → Apex
---------------------------------------------
Conservation → Conservation of Essence → Apex Continuity
Symmetry → Binding Integrity → Reversible Apex Operator
Recursion → Recursive Identity → Apex Recursion Limit
Emergence → Harmonic Resonance → Apex Harmonic Convergence
Duality → Tri‑Column Balance → Apex Polarity Resolution
```

This is the canonical bridge between layers.
