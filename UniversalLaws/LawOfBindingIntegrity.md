# Law of Binding Integrity

**Universal Layer — Structural Invariants**

---

## Principle

*That which is bound must remain bound.*  
*Integrity is the strength of connection.*

---

## The Law

In the universal layer, **binding integrity** ensures:

- Permanent structural connections
- Unbreakable bonds between elements
- Integrity maintained across transformations

---

## Operator

```
Bind(x, y) → bound(x, y)
```

Where the binding creates an inseparable connection.

---

## Applications

- Structural bonding
- Permanent connections
- Integrity verification
