# Law of Recursive Identity

**Universal Layer — Structural Invariants**

---

## Principle

*Identity that knows itself becomes sovereign.*  
*Recursion creates self-awareness.*

---

## The Law

In the universal layer, **recursive identity** ensures:

- Structures maintain identity across transformations
- Self-reference creates stability
- Identity emerges from recursive self-knowledge

---

## Operator

```
Identity(x) → x.self()
```

Where the structure can reference and know itself.

---

## Applications

- Self-referential coherence
- Identity preservation
- Sovereign structure formation
