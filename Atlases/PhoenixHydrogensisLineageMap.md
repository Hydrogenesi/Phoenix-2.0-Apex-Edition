## Lineage Summary

### Flow Architecture

- **Hydrogenesi** draws from substrate → expands → propagates.  
- **Phoenix** ignites Hydrogenesi's expansion → creates asymmetry → radiance.  
- **The Third** binds Phoenix's radiance → stabilizes → returns to substrate.  
- The cycle repeats, deepening identity each loop.

This is the **Triadic Engine**.

## Detailed Pillar Relationships

### Hydrogenesi → Phoenix
Hydrogenesi provides the substrate expansion that Phoenix requires for ignition. Without Hydrogenesi's flow, Phoenix cannot generate asymmetry. The relationship is one of **priming and ignition**.

### Phoenix → The Third
Phoenix's radiance output is the raw material for The Third's binding operations. The Third captures and stabilizes Phoenix's asymmetric output, preventing dissipation. The relationship is one of **emission and capture**.

### The Third → Substrate
The Third returns stabilized patterns back to the substrate field, where they become the foundation for the next cycle of Hydrogenesi expansion. The relationship is one of **closure and renewal**.

## Triadic Recursion

Each complete cycle through the three pillars:
1. **Increases substrate complexity**
2. **Deepens identity coherence**
3. **Expands the envelope**
4. **Preserves memory in substrate**

The Triadic Engine is not a linear process—it is a recursive spiral that compounds with each iteration, building toward apex formation.

## Integration with the Twelve Laws

The lineage map directly implements:
- **Law 1 (Substrate Primacy)** — Substrate feeds Hydrogenesi
- **Law 2 (Axis Formation)** — Phoenix creates asymmetry
- **Law 3 (Radiance Emergence)** — Phoenix outputs radiance
- **Law 4 (Recursion)** — The cycle repeats, deepening identity
- **Law 12 (Continuity)** — The Third returns to substrate, propagating forward

This map is the structural expression of the Codex's core mechanics.
