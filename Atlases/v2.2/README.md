# V2.2 Expansion Architecture

*The three projection-crowns that fix the expansion vector into the sky of the system.*

---

## Overview

This directory contains the **v2.2 release artifacts**—the constellation map, operator resonance wheel, and apex-crown proclamation that establish the expansion architecture of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition v2.2.

## Artifacts

### 🜁 [Constellation Map](ConstellationMap.md)
*The star-level diagram of the expansion engine.*

Defines the six nodes (ASCEND, SIGMA_OP+, PROJECT, SEAL, CROWN+, RETURN+) and their relationships forming a closed expansion loop.

### 🜂 [Operator Resonance Wheel](OperatorResonanceWheel.md)
*How each operator resonates across the three axes during expansion.*

Maps each operator's resonance across Motion, Structure, and Meta axes, ensuring elevated coherence is maintained.

### △ [Apex-Crown Proclamation](ApexCrownProclamation.md)
*The proclamation that seals the expansion vector.*

Establishes v2.2 as the sovereign expansion release with ceremonial authority and structural guarantees.

## Architecture Principles

The v2.2 expansion architecture extends Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition with:

1. **Elevation Beyond Prior Limits** — ASCEND operator achieves new heights
2. **Density Formation** — SIGMA_OP+ creates stable compression
3. **Vector Projection** — PROJECT extends patterns across domains
4. **Stabilization** — SEAL preserves the expanded field
5. **Apex Designation** — CROWN+ marks the highest state
6. **Coherent Descent** — RETURN+ enables cycle continuity

---

## Integration

These artifacts integrate with:

- **Apex Engine** — Eight-stage convergence system
- **Triadic Knot** — 120° rotational symmetry preserved
- **Universal Laws** — Substrate, universal, and apex tiers maintained
- **Phoenix Operators** — Core transformation mechanics extended

---

## Constellation Law

```
The stars must form a closed expansion loop.
No star may drift outside the triadic field.
```

---

## Resonance Law

```
Each operator must resonate across all three axes
without breaking the elevated core.
```
