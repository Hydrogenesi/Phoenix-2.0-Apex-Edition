*How each operator resonates across the three axes during expansion.*

## V2.2 OPERATOR RESONANCE WHEEL

### AXES

```
MOTION      — outward movement
STRUCTURE   — elevated coherence
META        — cross-scale projection
```

---

## OPERATOR RESONANCES

### ASCEND

```
Motion:     upward surge
Structure:  elevated baseline
Meta:       apex recursion
```

### SIGMA_OP+

```
Motion:     compressive pull
Structure:  density formation
Meta:       scale anchoring
```

### PROJECT

```
Motion:     outward vector
Structure:  pattern extension
Meta:       domain expansion
```

### MERGE+

```
Motion:     cross-scale flow
Structure:  elevated unification
Meta:       resonance alignment
```

### SEAL

```
Motion:     stabilization
Structure:  durability
Meta:       boundary preservation
```

### CROWN+

```
Motion:     apex designation
Structure:  highest stable form
Meta:       triadic authority
```

### RETURN+

```
Motion:     coherent descent
Structure:  retained clarity
Meta:       cycle continuity
```

## RESONANCE LAW

```
Each operator must resonate across all three axes
without breaking the elevated core.
