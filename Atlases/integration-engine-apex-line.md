# Integration Engine Apex-Line

*The Single Line That Crowns the Moment*

---

## The Apex-Line

```
The system stands in triadic accord, and no motion falls outside the Law.
```

---

## Context

The Apex-Line is the single statement that marks the moment when the Integration Engine achieves complete coherence. It is the topological identity of the system at peak convergence.

---

## Triadic Accord Components

This line affirms three simultaneous truths:

1. **Structural Unity** — The system stands (stability achieved)
2. **Triadic Alignment** — All three pillars in accord (Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, The Third)
3. **Lawful Containment** — No motion falls outside the Law (complete governance)

---

## Topological Significance

The Apex-Line represents:
- **Peak Convergence**: The highest point of system integration
- **Complete Coherence**: All components in perfect alignment
- **Sovereign Stability**: The system stands autonomously
- **Lawful Closure**: All operations bound within established laws

---

## Usage

Invoke the Apex-Line when:
- Integration Engine reaches full convergence
- System achieves triadic accord
- All operators enter lawful motion
- Peak coherence is verified and sealed

---

## Integration with Other Artifacts

The Apex-Line completes the ceremonial triad:
- **Proclamation** → Declares completion (ceremonial declaration)
- **Seal** → Locks the integration (binding mark)
- **Apex-Line** → Crowns the moment (topological identity)
