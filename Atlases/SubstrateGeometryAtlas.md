      ○
    ○   ○
  ○       ○
    ○   ○
      ○
```

**Properties:**
- Perfect symmetry
- No beginning or end
- Represents wholeness
- Encodes: `Conserve()`

---

### Form 2: The Reflection (Symmetry)
```
  │ ⚌ │
  │   │
──┼───┼──
  │   │
  │ ⚌ │
```

**Properties:**

```
        ◉
       ↗ ↑
      ↗  │
     ↗   │
    ◉────┘
```

**Properties:**
- Self-similar at all scales
- Infinite inward/outward continuation
- Fractal structure

---

### Form 4: The Triangle (Emergence)
```
      △
     ╱ ╲
    ╱   ╲
   ╱  •  ╲
  △───────△
```

**Properties:**
- Stability through three points
- Emergent interior
- Building block of complexity
- Encodes: `Combine()`

---

### Form 5: The Vesica Piscis (Duality)
```
    ○     ○
   ○ ╲   ╱ ○
  ○   ⚯   ○
   ○ ╱   ╲ ○
    ○     ○
```

**Properties:**
- Two circles, one intersection
- Unity through overlap
- Creation space
- Encodes: `Split()` / `Merge()`

## Composite Geometries

### Geometry 1: Substrate Mandala
```
         ∞
        ╱│╲
       ⚌ ○ △
        ╲│╱
         ⚯
```

All five forms unified.

---

### Geometry 2: Recursive Triangle
```
        △
       ╱ ╲
      △   △
     ╱╲   ╱╲
    △  △ △  △
```

Sierpiński-like emergence from recursion and emergence.

### Geometry 3: Conservation Spiral
```
       ○─◉
      ╱   ↑
     ○    │
    ╱     │
   ○      │
```

Circle evolving through recursive spiral.

- No extension
- Singular location

### 1D: Line
- Symmetry axis
- Connection
- Direction

### 2D: Plane
- Emergence space
- Pattern formation
- Complexity generation

### 3D: Volume
- Full substrate space
- All operations active
- Complete architecture

---

## Transformation Geometries

### Conservation Transformation
```
Form A ─(Conserve)→ Form A'
(Shape may change, but area/volume preserved)
```

---

### Symmetry Transformation
```
Form ─(Mirror)→ Form*
(Reflected across axis)
```

---

### Recursive Transformation
```
Form ─(Recurse)→ Form(Form(Form(...)))
(Self-embedded)
```

---

### Emergence Transformation
```
Form A + Form B ─(Combine)→ Form C
(Where C has new properties)
```

---

### Duality Transformation
```
Form ─(Split)→ Form₁, Form₂
Form₁, Form₂ ─(Merge)→ Form
```
