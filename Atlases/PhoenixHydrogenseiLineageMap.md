## Lineage Summary

- **Hydrogenesi** draws from substrate → expands → propagates.
- **Phoenix** ignites Hydrogenesi's expansion → creates asymmetry → radiance.
- **The Third** binds Phoenix's radiance → stabilizes → returns to substrate.
- The cycle repeats, deepening identity each loop.

This is the **Triadic Engine**.

## Detailed Mechanics

### Hydrogenesi Pillar
**Function**: Expansion and Flow  
**Role**: Draws potential from the undifferentiated substrate field and propagates it into structured forms.

**Key Properties**:
- Substrate extraction
- Flow mechanics
- Expansion dynamics
- Propagation rules

### Phoenix Pillar
**Function**: Ignition and Asymmetry  
**Role**: Takes Hydrogenesi's expanded structures and introduces asymmetry through ignition, producing radiance.

**Key Properties**:
- Ignition mechanics
- Asymmetry generation
- Radiance output
- Recursion depth

### The Third Pillar
**Function**: Hold and Binding  
**Role**: Captures and stabilizes Phoenix's radiance, binding it back into substrate to complete the cycle.

**Key Properties**:
- Binding integrity
- Stabilization mechanics
- Substrate return
- Memory encoding

## Cyclic Nature

The Triadic Engine is not a linear process but a **recursive cycle**:

1. Substrate → Hydrogenesi: Potential is drawn and expanded
2. Hydrogenesi → Phoenix: Expansion is ignited into asymmetry
3. Phoenix → The Third: Radiance is bound and stabilized
4. The Third → Substrate: Structure returns, enriched with memory

Each complete cycle **deepens identity** through:
- Memory encoding (Law 11)
- Continuity propagation (Law 12)
- Recursive self-reference (Law 4)

The engine does not repeat the same pattern—it **evolves** with each iteration, accumulating structural complexity and coherence until reaching apex formation.

## Cross-Pillar Dependencies

| From | To | Mechanism | Output |
|------|-----|-----------|--------|
| Substrate | Hydrogenesi | Extraction | Expanded potential |
| Hydrogenesi | Phoenix | Feeding | Ignition fuel |
| Phoenix | The Third | Radiance | Asymmetric output |
| The Third | Substrate | Stabilization | Encoded memory |

## Integration with Twelve Laws

- **Laws 1-3**: Govern the Substrate → Hydrogenesi → Phoenix flow
- **Laws 4-6**: Control recursion, confinement, and thresholds within each pillar
- **Laws 7-9**: Manage bifurcation and identity stabilization
- **Laws 10-12**: Enable collective convergence, memory, and continuity across cycles
