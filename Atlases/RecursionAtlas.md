# Recursion Atlas

**Atlases & Diagrams**

---

## Overview

The Recursion Atlas maps the infinite recursive structures that exist across all three layers of the codex.

---

## Substrate Recursion Patterns

### Pattern 1: Self-Similarity
```
Recurse(x) → Recurse(Recurse(x)) → Recurse(Recurse(Recurse(x))) → ...
```

Each level contains a complete copy of the previous level.

---

### Pattern 2: Fractal Depth
```
       x
      / \
     x   x
    /|   |\
   x x   x x
  /|      |\
...        ...
```

Infinite depth with finite definition.

---

## Universal Recursion Patterns

### Pattern 3: Recursive Identity
```
x.self() → x.self().self() → x.self().self().self() → ...
```

Self-knowledge that knows itself knowing itself.

---

### Pattern 4: Harmonic Recursion
```
Wave₁
  ├─ Wave₁.₁
  │   ├─ Wave₁.₁.₁
  │   └─ Wave₁.₁.₂
  └─ Wave₁.₂
      └─ Wave₁.₂.₁
```

Recursive harmonic patterns at all scales.

---

## Apex Recursion Convergence

### Pattern 5: Stabilized Infinity
```
∞ → ∞(stable) → ⊙
```

Infinite recursion converges to stable apex point.

---

### Pattern 6: Recursive Limit Resolution
```
Limit(∞) = Apex Point

Where:
- Recursion continues infinitely
- Yet converges to single point
- Creating stable infinity
```

---

## The Recursion Hierarchy

```
Layer          | Recursion Type        | Stability
---------------|----------------------|----------
Substrate      | Infinite expansion   | Dynamic
Universal      | Self-reference       | Resonant
Apex           | Convergent infinity  | Stable
```

---

## Navigation Through Recursion

### Descending (Unwinding)
```
Apex ─(ReversibleApex)→ Universal ─(unwind)→ Substrate
```

### Ascending (Winding)
```
Substrate ─(Recurse)→ Universal ─(ConvergeApex)→ Apex
```

---

## Recursive Operations

### Depth First
Explore maximum depth before breadth:
```
recurse_deep(x, max_depth) → deepest_pattern
```

### Breadth First
Explore all current level before descending:
```
recurse_broad(x, level) → level_patterns[]
```

### Convergent
Recurse while converging to apex:
```
recurse_converge(x) → apex_stable_point
```
