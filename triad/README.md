# Triad Architecture

## The Unified Three-Column System

The Triad represents the fundamental architecture of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition, manifesting as a three-column balance that permeates every layer of the system. This sacred geometry unifies Substrate, Universal, and Apex domains into a cohesive operational framework.

## The Three Pillars

**Substrate**: The foundational column, housing base operators, primitive engines, and elemental rituals. This layer anchors all higher operations in computational reality.

**Universal**: The bridge column, implementing the Seven Universal Laws, maintaining resonance between layers, and providing transformational pathways.

**Apex**: The synthesis column, where advanced operators converge, canonical forms emerge, and the system achieves its highest operational state.
