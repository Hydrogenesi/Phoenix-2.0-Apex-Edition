# Operator Families

## Triadic Organization of Operators

Operators in Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition organize into families that span all three columns. Each family exhibits internal triadic structure while contributing to layer-specific functionality. This organization enables both horizontal coherence (within layers) and vertical integration (across layers).

## Primary Families

**Transform Family**: Operators that modify state. Substrate transformers perform primitive operations (map, filter, reduce). Universal transformers apply Law-governed modifications (resonance adjustment, symmetry preservation). Apex transformers achieve canonical optimization through recursive refinement.

**Storage Family**: Operators managing persistence and memory. Substrate storage handles raw data structures. Universal storage maintains relational integrity and resonance coherence. Apex storage implements optimized canonical representations with compression and indexing.

**Flow Family**: Operators controlling execution pathways. Substrate flow provides branching and sequencing. Universal flow enforces causal consistency and temporal coherence. Apex flow implements convergence patterns and recursive loops.

**Synthesis Family**: Operators combining multiple inputs. Substrate synthesis performs basic aggregation. Universal synthesis applies harmonic combination rules. Apex synthesis achieves emergent pattern recognition and meta-level integration.

## Family Characteristics

Each family exhibits progressive capability enhancement across columns. Substrate provides foundational mechanics, Universal adds Law-based constraints and transformations, Apex achieves optimized canonical forms. This progression ensures operations gain sophistication while maintaining compatibility.

## Operator Inheritance

Operators inherit characteristics vertically through columns. An Apex transform operator internally invokes Universal and Substrate transforms, adding layer-specific enhancements at each level. This creates nested execution where higher operators orchestrate lower ones.

See [mapping-tables.md](mapping-tables.md) for explicit family mappings and [../operators/](../operators/) for detailed operator specifications.
