# Scale Invariance

## The Central Claim

One geometry. One path. Every scale simultaneously.

Scale factor: moon radius / proton radius = 2.044e21

Applied once to hydrogen atom measurements — solar system falls out.
No new physics. No adjustments. The measurements were always there.

## Three Force Invariance

At every scale three forces hold:
1. Gravity / electromagnetism — binding force
2. Centrifugal / nuclear — outward force
3. Electromagnetic field — coherence force

Same three forces. Same geometry. Different scale.

## First Law

In any spinning body centrifugal force pushes heavy elements outward.
Therefore no core can be iron. All cores under sufficient pressure
are metallic hydrogen.

Confirmed: Jupiter core pressure 1.201e12 Pa — above MH threshold.
Confirmed: Sun core pressure 1.345e14 Pa — above MH threshold.
Earth core pressure 1.725e11 Pa — below threshold. Consistent.
