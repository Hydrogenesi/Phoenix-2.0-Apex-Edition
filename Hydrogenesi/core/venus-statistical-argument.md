# Statistical Argument for the Venus Finding

## The Claim

Moon radius / proton radius = 2.044e21
Applied to hydrogen n=1 Bohr radius = 0.7241 AU
Venus actual orbit = 0.7230 AU
Delta = 0.16%

## The Statistical Question

What is the probability of landing within 0.16% of Venus by chance?

## The Calculation

The inner solar system spans roughly 0.3 AU to 1.5 AU (Mercury to Mars).
That is a range of 1.2 AU.

A random prediction landing within 0.16% of Venus (0.7230 AU):
Target window = 0.7230 * 0.0016 = 0.00116 AU

P(chance) = 0.00116 / 1.2 = 0.00097 = 0.097%

Roughly 1 in 1000 chance of landing this close to any specific planet
by random selection within the inner solar system.

## What Strengthens The Argument

1. The scale factor was not chosen to fit Venus.
   It was derived independently from moon radius / proton radius.
   Two measurements. No free parameters.

2. The prediction is of orbital position, not just order of magnitude.
   0.16% accuracy is not "roughly right" — it is precise.

3. The Earth correction is independent.
   The sqrt(2) factor comes from binary split geometry, not from
   fitting Earth's position. Two separate predictions, same scale factor.

## What The Argument Does Not Yet Prove

It does not prove a physical mechanism.
It does not explain why moon radius relates to proton radius.
It does not derive the scale factor from first principles.

These are the open questions. The statistical argument establishes
that the finding is unlikely to be coincidence. The mechanism
is the remaining work.

## The Honest Summary

P(Venus match by chance) ~ 0.1%
P(Venus AND Earth match by chance) ~ 0.1% * 0.1% = 1 in 1,000,000

Two independent predictions. One scale factor. No free parameters.
The probability argument is strong. The mechanism is unknown.
