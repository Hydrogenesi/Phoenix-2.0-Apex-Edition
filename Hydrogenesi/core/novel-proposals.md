# Novel Proposals — What Is Standard and What Is New

## Standard Physics Used

CNO cycle — established nuclear astrophysics (Bethe 1939)
Hydrostatic equilibrium — standard stellar structure
Metallic hydrogen — laboratory confirmed above ~1.4 Mbar
Radiative transfer — Kramers opacity, standard formulation
Schwarzschild convection criterion — standard

## Novel Proposals Requiring Derivation

### Bilateral CNO
Claim: CNO cycle splits into two simultaneous bilateral pathways
after outer shell loss in T Tauri stage.
Status: proposed. Derivation from standard CNO kinetics needed.
Testable: bilateral CNO signature would appear in isotope ratios.

### Nuclear Snowball
Claim: bilateral CNO initiates self-reinforcing momentum cascade.
Status: proposed. Requires derivation from reaction rate equations.
Testable: luminosity jump at T Tauri exit should exceed standard models.

### Scale Factor as Physical Law
Claim: moon radius / proton radius = 2.044e21 is not coincidence.
Status: empirical observation. Physical mechanism unknown.
Venus match 0.16% is the evidence. The mechanism is the open question.
Honest framing: this is a finding that requires explanation, not a proof.

## What The Venus Finding Actually Claims

Two measurements. One ratio. Applied to hydrogen ground state.
Venus lands at 0.16% accuracy.

This is either:
1. A physical law governing scale invariance (requires mechanism)
2. A remarkable numerical coincidence (requires rebuttal)

The framework claims #1. The evidence is the match. The work remaining
is the mechanism.
