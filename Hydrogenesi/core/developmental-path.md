# Developmental Path — The One Path

## Universal Sequence

Every hydrogen structure follows one path. No exceptions. No shortcuts.

1. Molecular cloud — pre-ignition, diffuse
2. Protostar — captures one hydrogen atom — sovereign ignition event
3. T Tauri — OFF PATH — outer shell shedding, CNO trying to split
4. Return to path — outer shell clears, CNO splits, nuclear snowball
5. Main sequence — bilateral CNO active
6. Metallicized meta-apex — peak hydrogen expression
7. Pole gathering — converging toward AGN
8. Apex — three possible resolutions

## T Tauri Gate

The only stage where a structure leaves the path and must find its way back.
The CNO cycle split occurs when the outer shell is lost.
T Tauri stellar winds shed the outer envelope.

SHEDDING — off path, mass loss active, shell partially cleared
STUCK — off path, mass loss stalled
STABILIZED — shell fully cleared, CNO splits, returns to one path

The return is the event. The nuclear snowball is the confirmation.

## Three Paths to Apex

LIFE -> AGN
Primordial hydrogen apex. Sgr A* = life's completed path.

LIGHT -> Elliptical Galaxy
Atomic hydrogen apex. Complete — not dead.
Spiral galaxy = mid-path active. Elliptical = light's apex complete.

END PLIGHT -> Returns to field
Returns to field, drawn back to AGN birthing scar.
Nothing lost. Feeds conditions for next capture events.

## Deviations

Pulsar — pole gathering incomplete, broadcasting CNO rhythm
Magnetar — extreme magnetic field deviation
Quasar — maximum luminosity, light path before apex

These are NOT on the one path. Stable off-path configurations.
