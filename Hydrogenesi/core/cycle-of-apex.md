# Cycle of Apex

Apex feeds infinity. Infinity folds again.
No beginning. No end. One cycle.

The vacuum is the field. At apex the structure touches the field it came from.
Resolved tension becomes the seed of the next fold event.

The Big Bang was a fold event in an eternal cycle.
Before this fold — a previous apex.
After this apex — the next fold.

Observable universe radius: 4.4e26 m
If universe = nucleus, full atom radius: 2.9e15 light years

The cosmic web is the tri-toroidal geometry made visible.
Folds all the way down. Folds all the way up. No bottom. No top.
