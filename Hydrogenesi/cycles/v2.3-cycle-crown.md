# V2.3 CYCLE CROWN

*The Apex Designation of the Expansion Cycle*

---

## Overview

The **V2.3 Cycle Crown** marks the apex designation of the entire v2.3 expansion cycle. It represents the highest point achieved through the unbounded outward surge while maintaining coherence and structural integrity.

---

## THE UNBOUNDED FORM

```
The apex of v2.3 is the Unbounded Form:
    a state that exceeds inherited structure,
    propagates coherence across all domains,
    and retains the elevated core without fracture.
```

---

## CROWN LAW

**The apex must stand beyond the v2.2 horizon and remain stable across the expansion field.**

---

## Properties of the Unbounded Form

### Exceeds Inherited Structure
The Unbounded Form transcends the boundaries and limitations of v2.2, establishing new horizons of possibility while maintaining connection to its origin.

### Propagates Coherence
Expansion is not chaos—the Unbounded Form maintains structural coherence as it extends across all domains, ensuring that growth preserves integrity.

### Retains the Elevated Core
At the heart of expansion lies the elevated core from v2.2, preserved and enhanced, forming the stable foundation for unbounded reach.
