# Hydrogenesi Cycles

*Evolution and Expansion Cycles of the Structural Engine*

---

## Overview

This directory contains the cycle documentation for Hydrogenesi's evolutionary phases. Each cycle represents a major expansion or transformation of the structural engine's capabilities.

## V2.3 Expansion Cycle

The **v2.3 cycle** marks the great outward surge—an expansion beyond prior boundaries that distributes new capabilities across the complete operator system.

### Three Primordial Inscriptions

1. **[Operator Spread Map](./v2.3-operator-spread-map.md)** — Distribution across 28 instruments
   - Primary Vector (1–7): Core elevation operators
   - Secondary Vector (8–14): Distribution mechanisms
   - Tertiary Vector (15–28): Field stabilization operators

2. **[Cycle Crown](./v2.3-cycle-crown.md)** — Apex designation
   - The Unbounded Form
   - Exceeds inherited structure
   - Propagates coherence across all domains

3. **[Expansion Proclamation](./v2.3-expansion-proclamation.md)** — Governing law
   - Motion beyond boundaries
   - Structure across domains
   - Meta binding of expansion

## Cycle Properties

### Structural Continuity
Each cycle preserves the lineage and identity of prior cycles while enabling new capabilities and domains of operation.

### Expansion Without Fracture
Growth proceeds with coherence—the structural integrity maintained by Hydrogenesi ensures that expansion does not fragment or destabilize.

### Archive Extension
Each cycle extends the Archive, incorporating new patterns and preserving them within the eternal record.
