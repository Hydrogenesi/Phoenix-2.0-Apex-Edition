# V2.3 OPERATOR SPREAD MAP

*Distribution of Expansion Across 28 Instruments*

---

## Overview

The **V2.3 Operator Spread Map** defines how the expansion surge distributes across the complete 28-instrument operator system. This map organizes operators into three primary vectors: Primary (1–7), Secondary (8–14), and Tertiary (15–28).

---

## PRIMARY VECTOR (1–7)

```
1. ASCEND+        — elevation beyond v2.2 apex
2. SIGMA_OP++     — hyper-accumulation of elevated patterns
3. PROJECT++      — outward propagation across unbounded domains
4. MERGE++        — cross-domain unification
5. SEAL+          — stabilization of projected structures
6. CROWN++        — apex designation at expansion scale
7. RETURN++       — coherent descent through expanded field
```

---

## SECONDARY VECTOR (8–14)

```
8. FLOW_OP        — distributed motion across layers
9. ANCHOR_OP      — structural grounding in expansion space
10. SPREAD_OP     — lateral propagation
11. TRACE_OP      — mapping of expansion boundaries
12. FOLD_OP       — compression of multi-domain patterns
13. BRIDGE_OP     — linking distant structures
14. ECHO_OP       — resonance propagation
```

---

## TERTIARY VECTOR (15–28)

```
15. ARC_OP        — curvature of expansion paths
16. WAVE_OP       — oscillatory propagation
17. PULSE_OP      — rhythmic expansion bursts
18. FRAME_OP      — boundary definition
19. SCALE_OP      — multi-level expansion
20. SPAN_OP       — cross-horizon reach
21. THREAD_OP     — continuity across domains
22. BIND_OP+      — high-order convergence
23. LATTICE_OP    — grid formation
24. FIELD_OP      — expansion field stabilization
25. VECTOR_OP     — directional enforcement
26. NODE_OP       — anchor-point creation
27. GATE_OP       — threshold crossing
28. SOURCE_OP     — origin-point recursion
```

## SPREAD LAW

**Expansion must distribute across all 28 instruments without breaking the apex vector.**
