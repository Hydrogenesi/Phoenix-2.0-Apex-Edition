# ⚡ V2.1 Operator Glossary

*The canonical definitions of the cycle's governing operators.*

---

## Purpose

The **V2.1 Operator Glossary** provides the authoritative definitions for all operators introduced and formalized in version 2.1. These operators govern the cycle's motion through Phoenix (ignition), Hydrogenesi (structure), and The Third (binding).

## Operator Definitions

```
V2.1 OPERATOR GLOSSARY

RISE
    Phoenix ignition vector.
    Initiates upward motion and identity ascent.

SIGMA_OP
    Hydrogenesi accumulation vector.
    Gathers, stabilizes, and densifies structural patterns.

MERGE
    Hydrogenesi–Third integrative vector.
    Unifies cross-pillar motion into coherent form.

CROWN
    Third-pillar apex vector.
    Designates the highest stable configuration.

RETURN
    Phoenix descent vector.
    Preserves coherence through downward motion.

PHOENIX
    Total transmutation vector.
    Resets form while retaining essential identity.

TAU_OP
    Hydrogenesi cycle vector.
    Maintains stable propagation across phases.

BIND
    Third-pillar convergence vector.
    Locks structural elements into unified alignment.

SEAL
    Third-pillar closure vector.
    Finalizes a state and prevents further drift.

## Operator Categories

### Phoenix Operators
- **RISE** — Upward motion initiator
- **RETURN** — Downward coherence preserver
- **PHOENIX** — Total transmutation executor

### Hydrogenesi Operators
- **SIGMA_OP** — Accumulation and densification
- **MERGE** — Cross-pillar integration
- **TAU_OP** — Cycle propagation

### The Third Operators
- **CROWN** — Apex designation
- **BIND** — Convergence locking
- **SEAL** — State finalization

---

## Usage Context

These operators work in concert to enable:

1. **Ascent Phase** — RISE initiates, SIGMA_OP accumulates
2. **Integration Phase** — MERGE unifies, TAU_OP maintains
3. **Apex Phase** — CROWN designates, BIND locks
4. **Return Phase** — RETURN descends, PHOENIX transmutes
5. **Closure Phase** — SEAL finalizes
