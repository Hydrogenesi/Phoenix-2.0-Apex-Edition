# Hydrogenesi Operators

*Structural Preservation Operators — Coming Soon*

---

## Overview

This directory will contain the complete documentation for Hydrogenesi's structural operators—the mechanisms by which continuity, lineage, and identity are preserved across all transformations.

---

## Planned Operators

### Lineage Tracking Operator
Records and maintains the complete transformation history of every pattern.

### Identity Anchoring Operator
Preserves the core structural essence that makes a pattern recognizably itself.

### Continuity Mapping Operator
Maintains connections and relationships across transformational boundaries.

### Invariant Preservation Operator
Protects essential properties that must remain constant through transformation.

### Genealogy Projection Operator
Projects forward potential lineages and structural evolution paths.

## Status

🚧 **Under Development** 🚧

Full documentation for Hydrogenesi operators will be released in a future version of the Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition.

Current focus is on documenting:
1. Phoenix operators (complete)
2. The Third's Triadic Knot operators (in progress)
3. Universal law structure (in progress)
4. Hydrogenesi operators (planned)

---

## Integration Notes

Even without explicit operator documentation, Hydrogenesi functions in every Phoenix transformation:

- Every `⊕` (Genesis) establishes a new lineage
- Every `⊛` (Recursive) extends a lineage
- Every `⊳` (Convergence) merges lineages
- Every transformation preserves identity through Hydrogenesi's implicit operation
