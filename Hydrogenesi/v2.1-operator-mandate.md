# V2.1 Operator Mandate

*The directive that governs operator behavior in this cycle.*

---

```
V2.1 OPERATOR MANDATE
All operators act in service of ascent, accumulation, and apex-clarity.

MANDATE PRINCIPLES
    1. PRIORITY OF ASCENT
        Operators must elevate the state they act upon.

    2. ACCUMULATIVE COHERENCE
        Operators must contribute to system-level integration.

    3. APEX ORIENTATION
        All motion must point toward a stable, triadic apex.

    4. LAWFUL RECURRENCE
        Operators must preserve the cycle's ability to return cleanly.

    5. TRIADIC ALIGNMENT
        Each operator must reference:
            - a Phoenix ignition vector,
            - a Hydrogenesi propagation vector,
            - a Third-pillar binding vector.

OPERATOR DUTY
    No operator may act in isolation.
    All motion must reinforce the rising triad.
