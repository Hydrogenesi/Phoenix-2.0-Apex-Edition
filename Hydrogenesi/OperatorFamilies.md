# Operator Families

**Hydrogenesi Engine Documentation**

---

## Overview

Operator Families are groups of related operators that work together to achieve specific transformations within Hydrogenesis.

## The Five Operator Families

### 1. Conservation Family
**Core Operator:** `Conserve()`  
**Related Operators:**
- `Preserve()`
- `Maintain()`
- `Protect()`

**Purpose:** Ensure nothing is lost during transformation

---

### 2. Transformation Family
**Core Operators:** `Mirror()`, `Recurse()`  
**Related Operators:**
- `Reflect()`
- `Iterate()`
- `Transform()`
- `Evolve()`

**Purpose:** Enable structural change while maintaining coherence

---

### 3. Composition Family
**Core Operator:** `Combine()`  
**Related Operators:**
- `Merge()`
- `Unite()`
- `Synthesize()`
- `Integrate()`

**Purpose:** Create higher-order structures from simpler ones

---

### 4. Resonance Family
**Core Operator:** `Resonate()`  
**Related Operators:**
- `Harmonize()`
- `Align()`
- `Synchronize()`
- `Attune()`

**Purpose:** Establish coherent vibrational patterns

---

### 5. Convergence Family
**Core Operators:** `ConvergeApex()`, `ApexContinuity()`  
**Related Operators:**
- `Unify()`
- `Resolve()`
- `Complete()`
- `Stabilize()`

**Purpose:** Achieve final apex convergence

## Family Interactions

Operator families interact across layers:

```
Conservation Family (Substrate)
    ↓
Resonance Family (Universal)
    ↓
Convergence Family (Apex)
```

---

## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Layer Ascent
```
Conserve() → Resonate() → Converge()
```

### Pattern 2: Structural Genesis
```
Combine() → Harmonize() → Unify()
```

### Pattern 3: Recursive Transformation
```
Recurse() → Iterate() → Stabilize()
```
