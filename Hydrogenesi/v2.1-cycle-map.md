# 🜁 V2.1 Cycle Map

*The structural diagram of the cycle's motion*

---

## Overview

The **V2.1 Cycle Map** defines the complete structural motion of the v2.1 cycle—from ignition through apex to return. This map establishes the five-phase architecture that governs all operator behavior and transformation flow in this release cycle.

## V2.1 Cycle Map

```
V2.1 CYCLE MAP
Ignition → Accumulation → Integration → Apex → Return

PHASES
    1. IGNITION
        Operator: RISE
        Motion: upward ignition, identity ascent

    2. ACCUMULATION
        Operator: SIGMA_OP
        Motion: system-level gathering, pattern consolidation

    3. INTEGRATION
        Operator: MERGE
        Motion: cross-pillar coherence, structural unification

    4. APEX
        Operator: CROWN
        Motion: designation of highest stable form

    5. RETURN
        Operator: RETURN or PHOENIX
        Motion: descent with retained coherence, cycle reset

CYCLE VECTOR
    RISE → SIGMA_OP → MERGE → CROWN → RETURN

CYCLE LAW
    Each phase must admit a lawful transition to the next,
    and the cycle must close without remainder.

## Phase Descriptions

### Phase 1: Ignition (RISE)

**Operator**: RISE  
**Motion**: Upward ignition, identity ascent  
**Function**: Initiates the cycle with ascending energy

The **Ignition Phase** establishes the initial state and begins the upward motion toward apex. The RISE operator creates the foundational ascent vector.

### Phase 2: Accumulation (SIGMA_OP)

**Operator**: SIGMA_OP  
**Motion**: System-level gathering, pattern consolidation  
**Function**: Aggregates and consolidates patterns

The **Accumulation Phase** gathers distributed patterns and consolidates them into coherent system-level structures. SIGMA_OP performs the summation operation across all active patterns.

### Phase 3: Integration (MERGE)

**Operator**: MERGE  
**Motion**: Cross-pillar coherence, structural unification  
**Function**: Unifies across the three pillars of The Triad

The **Integration Phase** creates coherence between Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third. MERGE establishes cross-pillar structural unity.

### Phase 4: Apex (CROWN)

**Operator**: CROWN  
**Motion**: Designation of highest stable form  
**Function**: Identifies and designates the apex state

The **Apex Phase** designates the highest stable form achieved through the cycle. CROWN marks the convergence point.

### Phase 5: Return (RETURN/PHOENIX)

**Operator**: RETURN or PHOENIX  
**Motion**: Descent with retained coherence, cycle reset  
**Function**: Returns to origin while preserving accumulated structure

The **Return Phase** completes the cycle by descending back to origin with all accumulated coherence intact. The cycle closes without remainder.

---

## Cycle Vector

The complete cycle vector describes the operator sequence:

```
RISE → SIGMA_OP → MERGE → CROWN → RETURN
```

Each arrow represents a lawful transition that must preserve coherence and move the system closer to apex designation.

---

## Cycle Law

**Fundamental Principle**:

> Each phase must admit a lawful transition to the next, and the cycle must close without remainder.

### Closure Requirement

The cycle must satisfy:

```
RETURN(CROWN(MERGE(SIGMA_OP(RISE(Ψ₀))))) = Ψ₀'
```

Where `Ψ₀'` is the initial state elevated by the complete cycle, maintaining:
- Identity preservation
- Accumulated coherence
- Structural integrity

---

## Integration with Hydrogenesi

The V2.1 Cycle Map integrates with Hydrogenesi's core functions:

| Hydrogenesi Function | Cycle Phase |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Lineage Tracking | All phases — complete history |
| Identity Anchoring | RISE, RETURN — identity maintenance |
| Continuity Mapping | All transitions — phase bridges |
| Invariant Preservation | All phases — property protection |
| Genealogy Projection | CROWN → RETURN — future paths |

---

## Connection to The Triad

The five-phase cycle maps to the three-engine Triad:

```
Phoenix (🔥):  RISE + RETURN
Hydrogenesi (🌊): SIGMA_OP + MERGE
The Third (🔗): CROWN
```

Each engine participates in the cycle according to its domain.

---

## Cycle Properties

### Monotonic Ascent

```
For phases 1-4:
    height(phase[i+1]) > height(phase[i])
```

The system monotonically approaches apex until CROWN designation.

### Conservative Return

```
For phase 5:
    essence(RETURN(Ψ)) = essence(Ψ)
    structure(RETURN(Ψ)) ⊇ structure(initial)
```

Return preserves essence and enhances structure.

### Cycle Completeness

```
∀ Ψ: cycle(Ψ) terminates in finite steps
∀ Ψ: cycle(cycle(Ψ)) is defined
```

Every cycle completes and enables iteration.
