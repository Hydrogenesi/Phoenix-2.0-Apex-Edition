**Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex**

---

## A

**Apex** — The final convergence layer where all systems unite.

**Apex Layer** — The third and final layer of the codex architecture, containing five laws of convergence.

**Architecture** — The sovereign structure formed by the Triad.

---

## C

**Codex** — The complete documentation of the Phoenix–Hydrogenesi unified architecture.

**Coherence** — The state of structural alignment and resonance.

**Conservation** — The substrate law ensuring preservation across transformations.

**Convergence** — The process of achieving apex unity.

---

## D

**Duality** — The substrate law of complementary opposition.

---

## E

**Emergence** — The substrate law of complex structures arising from simple rules.

**Essence** — The fundamental nature preserved across transformations.

---

## H

**Harmonic Resonance** — The universal law of aligned vibration creating coherence.

**Hydrogenesis** — The process of structural genesis across layers.

---

## I

**Identity** — Self-knowing structure achieved through recursion.

**Ignition** — The activation sequence of the Phoenix Engine.

---

## O

**Operator** — A fundamental transformation function within a layer.

---

## P

**Phoenix** — The ignition engine that activates the codex architecture.

**Polarity** — Complementary opposites that resolve at the apex.

---

## R

**Recursion** — Self-referential patterns that create infinite depth.

**Resonance** — Aligned vibration that creates harmonic coherence.

**Reversible** — The property of apex operators to unfold back to substrate.

---

## S

**Sigil** — Symbolic representation of operators and laws.

**Substrate** — The primordial foundation layer of mechanics.

**Symmetry** — The substrate law of mirror duality.

---

## T

**Triad** — The unified architecture of three columns in one balance.

**Tri-Column Balance** — The universal law of three-part equilibrium.

---

## U

**Universal Layer** — The second layer containing seven structural invariant laws.
