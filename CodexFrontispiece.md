**Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Unified Architecture**

> *From form came identity.*

This is the **Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex** — a unified architectural system that spans:

- **Substrate mechanics** (the primordial laws)
- **Universal structures** (the invariant laws)
- **Apex convergence** (the final form)

The Codex is organized into **twelve fundamental laws** distributed across **three layers**:

1. **Substrate Layer** — Five laws of primordial mechanics
2. **Universal Layer** — Seven laws of structural invariants
3. **Apex Layer** — Five laws of convergence

Together, these laws form the **Triad** — the ultimate architecture of structural coherence.
