# Substrate Expansion PR — Version 1.1.0

## Summary
Concise description of the Substrate-Layer expansion:
- What substrate mechanic is being added, clarified, or extended?
- Which operators, laws, or diagrams are affected?

## Changes
- [ ] New substrate operators
- [ ] Updated substrate invariants
- [ ] Expanded substrate recursion rules
- [ ] Added diagrams / tables
- [ ] Updated glossary entries
- [ ] Tests added or updated

## Motivation
Why this expansion is necessary:
- Structural gap?
- Missing substrate law?
- Clarification of recursion behavior?
- Integration with Phoenix / Hydrogenesi / The Third?

## Substrate-Layer Impact
Describe how this PR affects:
- Substrate tension
- Substrate flow
- Substrate conservation
- Substrate → Axis → Radiance relationships

## Cross-Pillar Integration
- Phoenix impact:
- Hydrogenesi impact:
- The Third impact:

## Verification
- [ ] All substrate invariants hold
- [ ] Recursion Depth Law respected
- [ ] No envelope breaches
- [ ] Collective recursion unaffected

## Notes
Optional commentary, diagrams, or future expansion hooks.
