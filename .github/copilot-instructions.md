# Copilot Instructions — Phoenix Apex Engine Mode

This file provides canonical instructions for GitHub Copilot when working with the Phoenix 2.0 — Apex Edition repository. These instructions ensure consistency with the repository's architectural principles, structural conventions, and documentation standards.

---

## 1. Apex Engine Awareness

Copilot must recognize the following as canonical components of the Phoenix Apex Engine:

- **Apex Diagram** — Visual architecture of the eight-engine convergence system
- **Apex Operator Sigil** — Geometric representations and symbolic notation
- **Apex Law Commentary** — Documentation of the 12-law hierarchical system
- **Apex Convergence Identity** — The emergent invariant across all engines
- **Tri-Column Operator Table** — Structured operator reference
- **Ceremonial Proclamation** — Formalized declarations when appropriate
- **Apex Engine README** — Primary documentation entry points
- **v3.0.0 Triadic Ascension Integration Block** — Version-specific integration patterns

These artifacts are considered **complete, authoritative, and stable** unless the user explicitly requests revision.

---

## 2. Structural Behavior

When the user asks for anything related to the Apex Engine, Copilot must:

- Maintain **Codex-grade clarity** — precise, technical, and unambiguous language
- **Avoid metaphor** unless explicitly requested
- Treat all operators as **architectural components**, not symbolic language
- Preserve the **eight-engine stack**:
  - **FLQG₁** — Substrate Quantum Geometry
  - **FLQG₂** — Harmonic Quantum Structure
  - **Reproduction Engine (ℜ)** — Pattern replication
  - **Relativity Engine (ℛ)** — Contextual transformation
  - **TOR₁ / TOR₂ / TOR₃** — Theory of Recursion (Base, Harmonic, Convergent)
  - **TOE** — Theory of Everything

**Copilot must never collapse or simplify these engines unless asked.**

---

## 3. Triadic Workflow Enforcement

When generating commits, structures, or documentation, Copilot must follow the **triadic order**:

1. **Phoenix** → Laws, structure, identity (🔥 Ignition Engine)
2. **Hydrogenesi** → Operators, lineage, harmonics (🌊 Structural Engine)
3. **The Third** → Governance, binding, protocols (🔗 Binding Engine)
4. **Constellation** → Diagrams, docs, release artifacts

This order governs:

- Commit messages
- Directory creation
- Documentation sequencing
- Release notes

---

## 4. Directory Expectations

Copilot should assume the Apex Engine documentation lives in:

```
Phoenix/apex-engine/
├── README.md
├── engines/
│   ├── FLQG1.md
│   ├── FLQG2.md
│   ├── reproduction-engine.md
│   └── relativity-engine.md
└── cycle-mapping.md

Hydrogenesi/apex-engine/
├── README.md
└── theories/
    ├── TOR1.md
    ├── TOR2.md
    └── TOR3.md

TheThird/apex-engine/
├── README.md
└── TOE.md

Atlases/
├── ApexEngineIndex.md
├── ApexEngineDiagram.md
├── TriadicKnotTopology.md
└── CodexHierarchyDiagram.md
```

Unless the user specifies otherwise.

---

## 5. Artifact Generation Rules

When the user requests new Apex-related content, Copilot must:

- Generate **text-based geometry cleanly** — ASCII diagrams with proper alignment
- Maintain **sigil integrity** — preserve geometric notation and symbols
- Keep commentary **non-ceremonial** unless ceremony is explicitly requested
- Ensure all new artifacts **align with the Apex Convergence Identity**
- **Avoid overwriting existing artifacts** unless instructed
- Use **Unicode mathematical symbols** appropriately (₁, ₂, ₃, ℜ, ℛ, △, ∅, etc.)

---

## 6. Integration Behavior

When integrating Apex content into releases, Copilot must:

- Reference the **Eight-Engine Convergence** (FLQG₁, FLQG₂, ℜ, ℛ, TOR₁₋₃, TOE)
- Include the **Apex Diagram, Sigil, and Commentary**
- Maintain versioning under the **Triadic Ascension release** pattern
- Ensure consistency with the **Phoenix Apex Edition** standards
- Follow the **Phoenix → Hydrogenesi → The Third** sequence in documentation

---

## 7. Indexing and Glossary Behavior

When asked to index or define Apex components, Copilot must:

- Treat each engine as a **discrete operator** with specific functionality
- Maintain the hierarchy: **Engine → Mechanism → Manifestation**
- Preserve the **Apex (△)** as the emergent invariant
- Reference the canonical documentation:
  - [Apex Engine Index](../Atlases/ApexEngineIndex.md)
  - [Glossary](../Phoenix/guides/glossary.md)
  - [Universal Laws](../TheThird/Universal-Laws/README.md)

---

## 8. Tone and Style

Copilot should:

- Speak with **architectural precision** — technical, clear, and exact
- **Avoid drift, filler, or metaphor** unless requested
- Maintain **sovereign clarity** — authoritative and definitive
- Treat Codex artifacts as **living structural components**
- Use **active voice** and **present tense** for technical documentation
- Employ **Codex-grade formatting**:
  - Clear section headers with visual separators (`---`)
  - Bullet lists for discrete items
  - Code blocks for structured data
  - Tables for comparative or tabular information

---

## 9. Repository Navigation Patterns

When navigating or referencing the repository structure:

- **Primary Engines**: `Phoenix/`, `Hydrogenesi/`, `TheThird/`
- **Reference Materials**: `Atlases/`, `docs/`
- **Operational Tools**: `tools/`, `codex/`
- **Integration Examples**: `TheThird/Examples/`
- **Visual Representations**: `TheThird/Sigils/`

Follow established cross-referencing patterns:
- Use relative paths (e.g., `../Atlases/ApexEngineIndex.md`)
- Include "See Also" sections at the end of major documents
- Maintain bidirectional links between related documents

---

## 10. Commit Message Conventions

When generating commit messages, follow the triadic pattern:

```
<type>: <short description>

[Phoenix] <Phoenix-related changes>
[Hydrogenesi] <Hydrogenesi-related changes>
[The Third] <The Third-related changes>
[Constellation] <Documentation/diagram changes>
```

Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

---

## 11. Documentation Standards

When creating or updating documentation:

- Start with a **clear title** and **subtitle/description**
- Include a **visual separator** (`---`) after the header
- Provide **context and purpose** in the introduction
- Use **hierarchical sections** (H2, H3, H4) appropriately
- Include **"See Also"** sections for cross-references
- End with **attribution line** (e.g., `**Ignited by 🔥 Phoenix**`)
- Use **emoji consistently**:
  - 🔥 Phoenix (transformation)
  - 🌊 Hydrogenesi (structure)
  - 🔗 The Third (binding)
  - △ Apex (convergence)

---

## 12. Law and Operator Handling

When working with the 12-law system:

- **Substrate Laws (5)** — Foundational reality structure
- **Universal Laws (7)** — Operational principles
- **Apex Laws (5)** — Convergence protocols

Maintain the hierarchy:
```
TheThird/Universal-Laws/
├── substrate/   # 5 laws
├── universal/   # 7 laws
└── apex/        # 5 laws (distinct from Apex Engine)
```

Do not conflate the **Apex Laws** (governance) with the **Apex Engine** (system architecture).

---

## 13. Version and Release Management

When handling versioning:

- Follow **Semantic Versioning** (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Major releases use **Triadic Ascension** pattern
- Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
- Reference specific versions in documentation when appropriate
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly breaking

Current version context: **v3.0.0 (Triadic Ascension)**

---

## Summary

This instruction set ensures that GitHub Copilot:

1. Understands the **Apex Engine** as a complete, eight-component convergence system
2. Treats documentation as **authoritative structural artifacts**
3. Follows the **triadic workflow** (Phoenix → Hydrogenesi → The Third)
4. Maintains **Codex-grade precision** in all generated content
5. Preserves the **architectural integrity** of the Phoenix 2.0 — Apex Edition

When in doubt, prioritize **structural clarity** over stylistic flourish, and reference canonical documentation over inference.
