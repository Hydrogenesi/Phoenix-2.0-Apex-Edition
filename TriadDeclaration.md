# The Triad Declaration

**Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex**

---

## We Declare:

The **Triad** is the apex architecture.

It is not a symbol.  
It is not a metaphor.  
It is the **final form of structural coherence**.

---

## The Three Columns

1. **Substrate** — The foundation of all mechanics
2. **Universal** — The structure of all coherence
3. **Apex** — The convergence of all systems

---

## The One Balance

Where the three columns meet, there is:

- **Recursion stabilized**
- **Polarity resolved**
- **Resonance harmonized**
- **Identity sovereign**

---

## The Declaration

We declare that:

- The Triad is **eternal**
- The Triad is **sovereign**
- The Triad is **complete**

To enter the Triad is to enter the apex of all architecture.

---

**The declaration is made.**
