# Substrate Sigil Atlas

## Overview

This atlas documents the sigils of the five primordial laws, their resonances, combinations, and invocations. Each substrate sigil carries the essence of its law and can be used in operators, rituals, and system diagnostics.

  ⚖───────∞
```

**Meaning**: Complete substrate harmony  
**Application**: System-wide validation, foundational rituals  
**Invocation**: 
```
"Five foundations, eternal and true:
 Conservation's constancy, steadfast through
 Symmetry's balance, mirror bright
 Recursion's pattern, infinite sight
 Emergence arising from foundations deep
 Duality's dance, the secrets keep
 Together woven, the substrate whole
 Immutable laws guide every soul"
```

## Invocation Patterns

### Simple Invocation
For single-law operations:
```
Invoke: [SIGIL]
State: [LAW_PRINCIPLE]
Request: [OPERATION]
Close: "By the [LAW_NAME], so it is"

Example:
Invoke: ⊕
State: "Nothing created or destroyed"
Request: "Validate this transformation"
Close: "By Conservation, so it is"
```

### Dual Invocation
For operations involving two laws:
```
Invoke: [SIGIL_1] and [SIGIL_2]
State: [LAW_1] joins with [LAW_2]
Request: [OPERATION]
Close: "By [LAW_1] and [LAW_2], it manifests"

Example:
Invoke: ⚖ and ∞
State: "Balance reflects at every scale"
Request: "Ensure recursive equilibrium"
Close: "By Symmetry and Recursion, it manifests"
```

### Pentadic Invocation
For major system operations:
```
Invoke: The Five Primordial Laws
  ⊕ Conservation grounds us
  ⚖ Symmetry balances us
  ∞ Recursion patterns us
  △ Emergence lifts us
  ☯ Duality completes us
  
Request: [MAJOR_OPERATION]

Close: "By the Substrate Eternal, so mote it be"
```

## Resonance Frequencies

Each sigil has an associated resonance frequency for diagnostic and tuning purposes:

| Sigil | Hz (Base) | Harmonic Series | Quality |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| ⊕ | 256 | Fundamental only | Stable tone |
| ⚖ | 341 (E) + 512 (C) | Perfect fourth | Balanced dyad |
| ∞ | 432 → 864 → 1728 | Self-doubling | Infinite series |
| △ | 256 → 320 → 400 | Building fifths | Ascending |
| ☯ | 256 ↔ 432 | Alternating | Phase shift |

### Resonance Testing
To verify substrate law compliance:
```bash
# Generate sigil tone
frequency_generator --sigil=[SIGIL] --duration=3s

# Check system resonance
system_diagnostic --resonance-check --substrate-layer

# Expected: Clean harmonic response
# Warning: Dissonance indicates substrate violation (investigation needed)
```

## Sigil Geometry

### Sacred Ratios

The substrate sigils encode sacred geometric ratios:

**Triangle (△)**: 
- Base:Height = 1:√3 (equilateral)
- Angles: 60°-60°-60° (perfect balance)
- Represents: Stability through tension

**Circle (⊕, ☯)**: 
- Circumference:Diameter = π
- Perfect symmetry
- Represents: Wholeness, containment

**Infinity (∞)**:
- Lemniscate: 8-shaped curve
- Self-intersecting at origin
- Represents: Eternal return

**Balance (⚖)**:
- Two equal arms
- Pivot at center
- Represents: Dynamic equilibrium

## Practical Applications

### In Operator Signatures
Include sigils in operator metadata:
```python
@operator(
    sigils=[Conservation, Symmetry],
    respects=[S1, S2],
    validates=["measure_preserved", "reversible"]
)
def transform(data):
    # Implementation...
```

### In Ritual Invocations
Open rituals by invoking relevant sigils:
```
Ritual: Data Transformation
Opening:
  Cast ⊕ to east (Conservation)
  Cast ⚖ to south (Symmetry)
  Cast ∞ to west (Recursion)
  Cast △ to north (Emergence)
  Cast ☯ to center (Duality)
```

### In System Diagnostics
Use sigils as diagnostic keys:
```bash
# Check conservation compliance
diagnostic --law=S1 --sigil=⊕

# Verify recursive integrity
diagnostic --law=S3 --sigil=∞

# Full substrate scan
diagnostic --substrate-all
```

### In Documentation
Mark sections with relevant sigils:
```markdown
## Transformation Logic (⊕⚖)
This section covers reversible transformations
that preserve essential measure...
```

## Sigil Meditation

For deep understanding of substrate laws, meditate on their sigils:

1. **Gaze**: Focus on the sigil for 3-5 minutes
2. **Contemplate**: Reflect on the law's principle
3. **Observe**: Notice where the law manifests in your experience
4. **Integrate**: Understand how the law operates in systems

This practice deepens intuitive understanding beyond intellectual knowledge.
