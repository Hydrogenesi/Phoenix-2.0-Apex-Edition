# U-5: Law of Apex Formation (Law V)

**Layer**: Universal | **Sigil**: ▲ | **ID**: U-5 | **Status**: Active

## Formal Statement

**Higher-order structures emerge from synthesis.**

When multiple elements align and resonate, apex structures form—higher-level patterns that transcend their components while exhibiting genuinely new properties.

## Mathematical Expression

```
Apex(C₁, C₂, ..., Cₙ) = Synthesis(Align(C₁,...,Cₙ))

where:
  Properties(Apex) ⊃ ⋃ᵢ Properties(Cᵢ)
  # Apex has properties none of the components have

Formation conditions:
  1. Sufficient component diversity
  2. Harmonic alignment (U-2)
  3. Critical mass threshold
  4. Resonant frequency match
```

## Explanation

Apex Formation describes how higher-order structures emerge when conditions are right. Not all combinations form apexes—only those that achieve sufficient alignment, diversity, and critical mass.

### Formation Conditions
1. **Component Diversity**: Homogeneous elements don't synthesize
2. **Alignment**: Components must resonate (U-2)
3. **Critical Mass**: Need enough components for apex to stabilize
4. **Catalyst**: Often requires trigger or focusing element

### Applications

**In System Architecture**: Apex capabilities emerge from subsystem synthesis
**In Rituals**: Apex moments arise from component alignment
**In Teams**: Apex performance emerges from member synergy
