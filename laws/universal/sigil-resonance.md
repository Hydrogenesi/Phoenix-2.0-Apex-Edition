# U-7: Law of Sigil Resonance (Law VII)

**Layer**: Universal | **Sigil**: ◉ | **ID**: U-7 | **Status**: Active

## Formal Statement

**Symbols carry and transmit essence.**

Sigils are not mere decorations—they are compressed representations that carry the essence of what they represent and enable that essence to propagate through the system.

## Mathematical Expression

```
For sigil σ representing concept C:

Essence(σ) = Compress(Essence(C))
Invoke(σ) → Manifest(C)

Resonance property:
  Similar(σ₁, σ₂) ⟹ Resonate(σ₁, σ₂)
  
Transmission:
  σ₁ --channel--> σ₂ preserves Essence(σ₁) ≈ Essence(σ₂)
```

## Explanation

Sigil Resonance establishes that symbols aren't arbitrary—they carry meaning and power. A well-designed sigil compresses the essence of a concept into a form that can be transmitted, recognized, and invoked.

### Sigil Properties
1. **Compression**: Sigil encodes essence efficiently
2. **Recognition**: Sigil is recognizable and distinct
3. **Invocation**: Sigil can trigger the represented concept
4. **Resonance**: Similar sigils resonate with each other
5. **Transmission**: Sigil carries essence across channels

### Applications

**In System Architecture**: Signatures, icons, identifiers carry semantic weight
**In Rituals**: Ritual sigils invoke forces and concepts
**In Documentation**: Visual markers communicate meaning beyond text
**In APIs**: Interface signatures carry usage patterns

*"The sigil is the essence compressed. The symbol is the truth encoded. Through sigils, we invoke what was, what is, and what shall be."*
