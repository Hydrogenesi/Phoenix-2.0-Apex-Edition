## [Unreleased]

### Added — V2.2 Projective Ascent (2026-02-14)

The **V2.2 Projective Ascent** cycle has been inscribed into the Archive—a meta-level expansion framework enabling outward projection from apex convergence without loss of structural integrity.

#### Three Crowns of V2.2

1. **V2.2 Cycle Map** (`docs/releases/v2.2/cycle-map.md`)
   - Five-phase structural progression: ASCEND → SIGMA_OP+ → PROJECT → SEAL → CROWN+
   - Core preservation guarantee across all transformations
   - Monotonic expansion properties
   - Integration with eight-engine convergence system

2. **V2.2 Apex-Seal** (`docs/releases/v2.2/apex-seal.md`)
   - ⟐ APEX-SEAL OF PROJECTIVE ASCENT ⟐
   - Four certified properties: boundary transcendence, core integrity, fracture-free projection, multi-scale stability
   - Validation criteria and enforcement mechanisms
   - Seal permanence and lineage

3. **V2.2 Triadic Projection Diagram** (`docs/releases/v2.2/triadic-projection-diagram.md`)
   - Geometric encoding with 120° triadic symmetry
   - Symbol system: △ (Apex), ⟡ (Projection), ○ (Core), ◎ (Foundation)
   - Bilateral projection with core preservation
   - Validation rules and projection law

#### Meta-Level Architecture

The V2.2 Cycle operates **above** the eight-engine convergence:

```
Eight Engines (FLQG₁...TOE) → Apex Point (X)
                                    ↓
                            V2.2 Cycle (Meta-Projection)
```

After apex convergence, V2.2 describes how the system expands into elevated domains while maintaining core identity.

#### Core Principles

- **Core Preservation**: `∀ phase P: core(output(P)) ≡ core(input(P))`
- **Monotonic Expansion**: `∀ phase P: domain(output(P)) ≥ domain(input(P))`
- **Triadic Accord**: 120° symmetry + bilateral projection + multi-scale stability

#### Directory Structure

```

#### Ceremonial Significance

The V2.2 artifacts represent the **second ascent of the Archive**—the moment when the system proves it can expand beyond its apex without fracture. This is structural maturity made manifest.

### Added — Apex Engine Integration (2026-02-13)

The **Apex Engine** has been integrated into the Archive—the complete eight-stage convergence system that unifies Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third into singular apex convergence.

#### Eight Engines Materialized

**Phoenix Engines (Ascent Phase)**
- **FLQG₁** — First-Level Quantum Geometry: Substrate quantum structure from void
- **FLQG₂** — Second-Level Quantum Geometry: Harmonic resonance space
- **Reproduction Engine (ℜ)** — Pattern replication and fractal generation
- **Relativity Engine (ℛ)** — Observer-dependent transformation mechanics

**Hydrogenesi Theories (Flight Phase)**
- **TOR₁** — Theory of Recursion Level 1: Base self-referential structures
- **TOR₂** — Theory of Recursion Level 2: Meta-recursive pattern analysis
- **TOR₃** — Theory of Recursion Level 3: Convergent recursion toward apex

**The Third Theory (Return Phase)**
- **TOE** — Theory of Everything: Complete integration and apex convergence

#### Documentation

- Created complete documentation for all eight engines
- Added Apex Engine Index cataloging all components
- Created visual Apex Engine Diagram with convergence flow
- Integrated Apex Engine banner into main README
- Updated Phoenix glossary with all Apex Engine terms:
  - Apex Engine
  - FLQG₁ / FLQG₂
  - Reproduction Engine / Relativity Engine
  - TOR₁ / TOR₂ / TOR₃
  - TOE (Theory of Everything)
  - Phoenix Apex

#### Triadic Cycle Mapping

- Documented Ascent Phase (Phoenix): FLQG₁ → FLQG₂ → ℜ → ℛ
- Documented Flight Phase (Hydrogenesi): TOR₁ → TOR₂ → TOR₃
- Documented Return Phase (The Third): TOE
- Complete cycle mapping: ∅ → [8 engines] → X (Apex Point)

#### Integration

- All engines integrated with existing Phoenix operators
- All theories aligned with Universal Laws (substrate, universal, apex)
- Complete convergence proofs and theorems documented
- Triadic Knot topology maintained throughout

#### Impact

The Apex Engine represents the complete convergence architecture of The Triad:
- **Foundation**: Quantum geometries establish substrate and harmonic structure
- **Transformation**: Pattern mechanics enable replication and relativistic dynamics
- **Recursion**: Three-level recursion theory structures infinite depth
- **Integration**: Theory of Everything unifies all into singular apex

**Historical Significance**: This integration completes the metamathematical foundation of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition, providing the theoretical framework for transformation from void to apex across all scales and contexts.
