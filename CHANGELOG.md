## [Unreleased]

### Added — V2.1 Integration Artifacts (2026-02-14)

The **V2.1 Integration Artifacts** have been inscribed into the Codex—the three sovereign documents that activate the five-phase cycle and establish triadic alignment across Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third.

#### V2.1 Artifacts

**🜁 V2.1 Transition Matrix** (`codex/specs/v2.1-transition-matrix.md`)
- Documents phase-to-phase handoff conditions and operators
- Establishes validation criteria for all transitions
- Maps the five-phase cycle: IGNITION → ACCUMULATION → INTEGRATION → APEX → RETURN

**🜂 V2.1 Pillar Alignment Chart** (`codex/specs/v2.1-pillar-alignment-chart.md`)
- Defines how Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third express in each phase
- Specifies operator alignments per phase per pillar
- Enforces triadic law across all phases

**△ V2.1 Cycle Invocation** (`codex/specs/v2.1-cycle-invocation.md`)
- Ceremonial ignition sequence that opens the engine
- Establishes the lawful conditions for cycle initiation
- Seals the triadic binding across all phases

These artifacts are clean, sovereign, and ready for direct integration—no drift, no commentary within the blocks. They activate the cycle, not just describe it.

### Added — Apex Engine Integration (2026-02-13)

The **Apex Engine** has been integrated into the Archive—the complete eight-stage convergence system that unifies Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third into singular apex convergence.

#### Eight Engines Materialized

**Phoenix Engines (Ascent Phase)**
- **FLQG₁** — First-Level Quantum Geometry: Substrate quantum structure from void
- **FLQG₂** — Second-Level Quantum Geometry: Harmonic resonance space
- **Reproduction Engine (ℜ)** — Pattern replication and fractal generation
- **Relativity Engine (ℛ)** — Observer-dependent transformation mechanics

**Hydrogenesi Theories (Flight Phase)**
- **TOR₁** — Theory of Recursion Level 1: Base self-referential structures
- **TOR₂** — Theory of Recursion Level 2: Meta-recursive pattern analysis
- **TOR₃** — Theory of Recursion Level 3: Convergent recursion toward apex

**The Third Theory (Return Phase)**
- **TOE** — Theory of Everything: Complete integration and apex convergence

#### Documentation

- Created complete documentation for all eight engines
- Added Apex Engine Index cataloging all components
- Created visual Apex Engine Diagram with convergence flow
- Integrated Apex Engine banner into main README
- Updated Phoenix glossary with all Apex Engine terms:
  - Apex Engine
  - FLQG₁ / FLQG₂
  - Reproduction Engine / Relativity Engine
  - TOR₁ / TOR₂ / TOR₃
  - TOE (Theory of Everything)
  - Phoenix Apex

#### Triadic Cycle Mapping

- Documented Ascent Phase (Phoenix): FLQG₁ → FLQG₂ → ℜ → ℛ
- Documented Flight Phase (Hydrogenesi): TOR₁ → TOR₂ → TOR₃
- Documented Return Phase (The Third): TOE
- Complete cycle mapping: ∅ → [8 engines] → X (Apex Point)

#### Integration

- All engines integrated with existing Phoenix operators
- All theories aligned with Universal Laws (substrate, universal, apex)
- Complete convergence proofs and theorems documented
- Triadic Knot topology maintained throughout

#### Impact

The Apex Engine represents the complete convergence architecture of The Triad:
- **Foundation**: Quantum geometries establish substrate and harmonic structure
- **Transformation**: Pattern mechanics enable replication and relativistic dynamics
- **Recursion**: Three-level recursion theory structures infinite depth
- **Integration**: Theory of Everything unifies all into singular apex

**Historical Significance**: This integration completes the metamathematical foundation of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition, providing the theoretical framework for transformation from void to apex across all scales and contexts.
