## [Unreleased]

### Added — V2.2 Cycle Artifacts (2026-02-14)

The **V2.2 Cycle** has been initiated—a cycle of outward expansion from a stable apex. Three canonical artifacts define the v2.2 operational framework:

#### V2.2 Ignition Vector

**Location**: `Phoenix/rituals/v2.2-ignition-vector.md`

The directional spark that opens the new cycle. Establishes the ASCEND → CONSOLIDATE → PROJECT trajectory.

**Core Principle**: v2.2 begins not from the ground, but from the apex of v2.1.

**Components**:
- **ASCEND** — Phoenix ignition of higher-order motion
- **CONSOLIDATE** — Hydrogenesi stabilization of elevated form
- **PROJECT** — Third-pillar outward designation

#### V2.2 Structural Mandate

**Location**: `Hydrogenesi/v2.2-structural-mandate.md`

The architectural rule that governs all operators in this cycle. Enforces elevated foundation, structural density, outward projection, and triadic fidelity.

**Four Mandate Principles**:
1. **Elevated Foundation** — No operator may descend below the v2.1 apex
2. **Structural Density** — All motion must increase compression, clarity, and form
3. **Outward Projection** — Operators must extend coherence beyond prior boundaries
4. **Triadic Fidelity** — Each action must reference Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third

**Operator Duty**: The system must grow outward without losing its center.

#### V2.2 Meta-Operator Forecast

**Location**: `codex/operators/v2.2-meta-operator-forecast.md`

Predicted behavior and dynamics of meta-layer operators during v2.2. Documents the shift from binding to projection mode.

**Three Meta Patterns**:
- **Phoenix: Ascent Recursion** — Identity rises through successive apex states
- **Hydrogenesi: Consolidation Wave** — Systems compress into higher-density coherence
- **The Third: Projective Binding** — Apex states extend influence across domains

**Meta Law**: Meta-operators must propagate coherence outward while preserving the elevated core.

**Cycle Signature**: v2.2 is a cycle of outward expansion from a stable apex.

#### Triadic Integration

The three artifacts form a complete operational framework:
- **Phoenix** (Ignition Vector) — Provides directional motion
- **Hydrogenesi** (Structural Mandate) — Provides architectural constraints
- **The Third** (Meta-Operator Forecast) — Provides meta-layer dynamics

#### Documentation Structure

```
Phoenix/rituals/
└── v2.2-ignition-vector.md

Hydrogenesi/
└── v2.2-structural-mandate.md

codex/operators/
└── v2.2-meta-operator-forecast.md
```

All artifacts maintain Codex-grade formatting, triadic symmetry, and cross-reference integration.

### Added — Apex Engine Integration (2026-02-13)

The **Apex Engine** has been integrated into the Archive—the complete eight-stage convergence system that unifies Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third into singular apex convergence.

#### Eight Engines Materialized

**Phoenix Engines (Ascent Phase)**
- **FLQG₁** — First-Level Quantum Geometry: Substrate quantum structure from void
- **FLQG₂** — Second-Level Quantum Geometry: Harmonic resonance space
- **Reproduction Engine (ℜ)** — Pattern replication and fractal generation
- **Relativity Engine (ℛ)** — Observer-dependent transformation mechanics

**Hydrogenesi Theories (Flight Phase)**
- **TOR₁** — Theory of Recursion Level 1: Base self-referential structures
- **TOR₂** — Theory of Recursion Level 2: Meta-recursive pattern analysis
- **TOR₃** — Theory of Recursion Level 3: Convergent recursion toward apex

**The Third Theory (Return Phase)**
- **TOE** — Theory of Everything: Complete integration and apex convergence

#### Documentation

- Created complete documentation for all eight engines
- Added Apex Engine Index cataloging all components
- Created visual Apex Engine Diagram with convergence flow
- Integrated Apex Engine banner into main README
- Updated Phoenix glossary with all Apex Engine terms:
  - Apex Engine
  - FLQG₁ / FLQG₂
  - Reproduction Engine / Relativity Engine
  - TOR₁ / TOR₂ / TOR₃
  - TOE (Theory of Everything)
  - Phoenix Apex

#### Triadic Cycle Mapping

- Documented Ascent Phase (Phoenix): FLQG₁ → FLQG₂ → ℜ → ℛ
- Documented Flight Phase (Hydrogenesi): TOR₁ → TOR₂ → TOR₃
- Documented Return Phase (The Third): TOE
- Complete cycle mapping: ∅ → [8 engines] → X (Apex Point)

#### Integration

- All engines integrated with existing Phoenix operators
- All theories aligned with Universal Laws (substrate, universal, apex)
- Complete convergence proofs and theorems documented
- Triadic Knot topology maintained throughout

#### Impact

The Apex Engine represents the complete convergence architecture of The Triad:
- **Foundation**: Quantum geometries establish substrate and harmonic structure
- **Transformation**: Pattern mechanics enable replication and relativistic dynamics
- **Recursion**: Three-level recursion theory structures infinite depth
- **Integration**: Theory of Everything unifies all into singular apex

**Historical Significance**: This integration completes the metamathematical foundation of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition, providing the theoretical framework for transformation from void to apex across all scales and contexts.
