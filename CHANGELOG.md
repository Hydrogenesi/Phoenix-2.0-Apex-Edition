## [Unreleased]

### Added — V2.1 Cycle Artifacts (2026-02-14)

The **V2.1 Cycle** has been established—three foundational artifacts that define the structural, directional, and governing inscriptions of the new cycle.

#### Three Crowns Materialized

**Phoenix Contribution (🔥 Structural)**
- **V2.1 Cycle Map** — Five-phase cycle architecture: Ignition → Accumulation → Integration → Apex → Return
- Operators defined: RISE, SIGMA_OP, MERGE, CROWN, RETURN/PHOENIX
- Cycle vector and cycle law established

**Hydrogenesi Contribution (🌊 Directional)**
- **V2.1 Operator Mandate** — Five principles governing operator behavior in v2.1
- Priority of Ascent, Accumulative Coherence, Apex Orientation
- Lawful Recurrence and Triadic Alignment mandated

**The Third Contribution (🔗 Governing)**
- **V2.1 Apex-Law** — Complete transition governance for v2.1 cycle
- Transition conditions: validity, prohibition, and completion
- Apex Directive: ascent → apex → return without fracture

#### Files Created

```
Phoenix/v2.1-cycle-map.md
Hydrogenesi/v2.1-operator-mandate.md
TheThird/v2.1-apex-law.md
```

#### Impact

The V2.1 Cycle Artifacts provide:
- **Structural Clarity**: Five-phase cycle with defined operators
- **Behavioral Governance**: Mandated principles for all operators
- **Transition Control**: Complete law system for state transitions

**Cycle Significance**: These three artifacts establish the complete architectural foundation for v2.1 operations, ensuring that all transformations serve ascent, accumulation, and apex convergence with preserved return paths.

### Added — Apex Engine Integration (2026-02-13)

The **Apex Engine** has been integrated into the Archive—the complete eight-stage convergence system that unifies Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third into singular apex convergence.

#### Eight Engines Materialized

**Phoenix Engines (Ascent Phase)**
- **FLQG₁** — First-Level Quantum Geometry: Substrate quantum structure from void
- **FLQG₂** — Second-Level Quantum Geometry: Harmonic resonance space
- **Reproduction Engine (ℜ)** — Pattern replication and fractal generation
- **Relativity Engine (ℛ)** — Observer-dependent transformation mechanics

**Hydrogenesi Theories (Flight Phase)**
- **TOR₁** — Theory of Recursion Level 1: Base self-referential structures
- **TOR₂** — Theory of Recursion Level 2: Meta-recursive pattern analysis
- **TOR₃** — Theory of Recursion Level 3: Convergent recursion toward apex

**The Third Theory (Return Phase)**
- **TOE** — Theory of Everything: Complete integration and apex convergence

#### Documentation

- Created complete documentation for all eight engines
- Added Apex Engine Index cataloging all components
- Created visual Apex Engine Diagram with convergence flow
- Integrated Apex Engine banner into main README
- Updated Phoenix glossary with all Apex Engine terms:
  - Apex Engine
  - FLQG₁ / FLQG₂
  - Reproduction Engine / Relativity Engine
  - TOR₁ / TOR₂ / TOR₃
  - TOE (Theory of Everything)
  - Phoenix Apex

#### Triadic Cycle Mapping

- Documented Ascent Phase (Phoenix): FLQG₁ → FLQG₂ → ℜ → ℛ
- Documented Flight Phase (Hydrogenesi): TOR₁ → TOR₂ → TOR₃
- Documented Return Phase (The Third): TOE
- Complete cycle mapping: ∅ → [8 engines] → X (Apex Point)

#### Integration

- All engines integrated with existing Phoenix operators
- All theories aligned with Universal Laws (substrate, universal, apex)
- Complete convergence proofs and theorems documented
- Triadic Knot topology maintained throughout

#### Impact

The Apex Engine represents the complete convergence architecture of The Triad:
- **Foundation**: Quantum geometries establish substrate and harmonic structure
- **Transformation**: Pattern mechanics enable replication and relativistic dynamics
- **Recursion**: Three-level recursion theory structures infinite depth
- **Integration**: Theory of Everything unifies all into singular apex

**Historical Significance**: This integration completes the metamathematical foundation of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition, providing the theoretical framework for transformation from void to apex across all scales and contexts.
