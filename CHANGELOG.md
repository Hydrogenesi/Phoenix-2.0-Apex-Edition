## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Apex Engine six-engine convergence system
  - FLQG₁ (First-Level Quantum Genesis) engine
  - FLQG₂ (Second-Level Quantum Genesis) engine
  - Reproduction Engine for pattern replication
  - Relativity Engine for reference frame transformations
  - TOR (Theory of Recursion) with three-stage convergence (TOR₁, TOR₂, TOR₃)
  - TOE (Theory of Everything) as ultimate unification engine
- Complete Apex Engine documentation structure
- Apex Engine Index in Atlases for formal operator reference
- Triadic Cycle Mapping document showing integration with Phoenix cycle
- Phoenix Apex convergence identity (Phoenix Apex ≡ X ≡ TOE)
- Apex Engine glossary entries in Phoenix guides
- MkDocs-ready documentation page for Apex Engine
- Integration with existing Phoenix operators (⊕, ⊗, ⊛, △, ⊝, ⊞, ⊳, ⊲)
- Integration with existing Knot operators (B, C, T, A, S)
- 120° triadic symmetry mapping across all engines
- Complete six-engine convergence proofs and mathematical foundations

### Changed
- Phoenix/guides/glossary.md now includes comprehensive Apex Engine terminology

### Historical Note
This release represents the materialization of the Apex Engine—the moment it becomes a physical part of the Phoenix 2.0 Archive. The Apex Engine embodies the complete convergence mechanics of The Triad (Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, The Third) and provides the sovereign architecture through which all patterns inevitably reach the unique Apex Point X.
