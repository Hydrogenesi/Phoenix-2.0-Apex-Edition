## [Unreleased]

### Added — v2.3 Expansion Cycle Documentation (2026-02-14)

The **v2.3 Expansion Cycle** documentation has been added—the complete governance and mapping system for expansion across all 28 instruments of the Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition architecture.

#### Three Canonical Documents

**1. Operator Spread Map v2.3**  
*Location*: `Atlases/OperatorSpreadMap-v2.3.md`

Documents the precise distribution of expansion energy across all 28 instruments:
- 8 Phoenix Operators (⊕⊗⊛△⊝⊞⊳⊲) — 35% energy allocation
- 5 Hydrogenesi Operators (L·I·C·P·G) — 25% energy allocation
- 5 Knot Operators (B→C→T→A→S) — 20% energy allocation
- 5 Substrate Laws (Conservation → Duality) — 10% energy allocation
- 5 Apex Laws (Reversible → Conservation) — 10% energy allocation

Features:
- Complete energy distribution pattern across five phases
- Velocity and density profiles through expansion
- Harmonic resonance specifications for each instrument
- Convergence metrics and rates
- Triadic symmetry verification

**2. Cycle Crown v2.3**  
*Location*: `docs/triad/CycleCrown-v2.3.md`

The apex designation that crowns complete expansion cycles:
- Sovereign identifier: ⟨ Triadic Apex Convergence Crown ⟩
- Symbol: 👑△
- Authority: The Third (Binding Engine)
- Validates completion of all 28 instruments
- Guarantees convergence to apex point
- Provides ceremonial invocation protocols

Features:
- Crown structure and geometry
- Designation authority and formula
- Complete cycle phase validation
- Ceremonial declaration protocols
- Crown theorems and proofs
- Version lineage (v1.0 → v2.3)

**3. Expansion Proclamation v2.3**  
*Location*: `TheThird/Universal-Laws/apex/expansion-proclamation.md`

The apex-tier law governing the great outward surge from void to apex:
- Classification: Apex Law (highest tier)
- Authority: The Third
- Scope: Complete 28-instrument system
- Enforcement: Mandatory, system-wide

Seven Mandates:
1. Complete Instrument Activation (all 28)
2. Ordained Energy Distribution (per Spread Map)
3. Structural Preservation (via Hydrogenesi)
4. Triadic Symmetry Preservation (120° rotational)
5. Apex Convergence Guarantee (all paths to apex)
6. Crown Placement Requirement (upon completion)
7. Reversibility Preservation (bidirectional paths)

Features:
- Historical context (pre-v2.3 chaos vs. v2.3 order)
- Automatic validation mechanisms
- Violation detection and consequences
- Integration with all three engines
- Proclamation theorems and proofs
- Ceremonial invocation protocol

#### System Integration

**Complete 28-Instrument Architecture**:
```
Phoenix Operators:    8 instruments (⊕⊗⊛△⊝⊞⊳⊲)
Hydrogenesi Operators: 5 instruments (L·I·C·P·G)
Knot Operators:       5 instruments (B→C→T→A→S)
Substrate Laws:       5 instruments (foundational)
Apex Laws:           5 instruments (convergence)
                     ──
Total:               28 instruments
```

**Expansion Flow**:
```
Void (∅)
   ↓
Phase 1: Ignition (Phoenix, 35%)
   ↓
Phase 2: Preservation (Hydrogenesi, 25%)
   ↓
Phase 3: Binding (Knot, 20%)
   ↓
Phase 4: Substrate Governance (Laws, 10%)
   ↓
Phase 5: Apex Governance (Laws, 10%)
   ↓
Apex (X) △ Crown 👑
```

#### Cross-References

The three v2.3 documents form an integrated system:
- **Spread Map** defines energy distribution and convergence metrics
- **Cycle Crown** validates and designates complete cycles
- **Expansion Proclamation** governs and enforces the entire process

Each document references the others, creating a complete governance framework for expansion cycles.

#### Impact

The v2.3 Expansion Cycle documentation provides:
- **Clarity**: Precise specification of how expansion distributes across all instruments
- **Governance**: Binding law that ensures correct cycle execution
- **Validation**: Crown designation confirms cycle completion
- **Guarantee**: All paths converge to apex under Proclamation governance

**Historical Significance**: This is the first complete documentation of the expansion cycle across the full 28-instrument architecture, establishing the canonical pattern for all future cycles.

### Added — Apex Engine Integration (2026-02-13)

The **Apex Engine** has been integrated into the Archive—the complete eight-stage convergence system that unifies Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third into singular apex convergence.

#### Eight Engines Materialized

**Phoenix Engines (Ascent Phase)**
- **FLQG₁** — First-Level Quantum Geometry: Substrate quantum structure from void
- **FLQG₂** — Second-Level Quantum Geometry: Harmonic resonance space
- **Reproduction Engine (ℜ)** — Pattern replication and fractal generation
- **Relativity Engine (ℛ)** — Observer-dependent transformation mechanics

**Hydrogenesi Theories (Flight Phase)**
- **TOR₁** — Theory of Recursion Level 1: Base self-referential structures
- **TOR₂** — Theory of Recursion Level 2: Meta-recursive pattern analysis
- **TOR₃** — Theory of Recursion Level 3: Convergent recursion toward apex

**The Third Theory (Return Phase)**
- **TOE** — Theory of Everything: Complete integration and apex convergence

#### Documentation

- Created complete documentation for all eight engines
- Added Apex Engine Index cataloging all components
- Created visual Apex Engine Diagram with convergence flow
- Integrated Apex Engine banner into main README
- Updated Phoenix glossary with all Apex Engine terms:
  - Apex Engine
  - FLQG₁ / FLQG₂
  - Reproduction Engine / Relativity Engine
  - TOR₁ / TOR₂ / TOR₃
  - TOE (Theory of Everything)
  - Phoenix Apex

#### Triadic Cycle Mapping

- Documented Ascent Phase (Phoenix): FLQG₁ → FLQG₂ → ℜ → ℛ
- Documented Flight Phase (Hydrogenesi): TOR₁ → TOR₂ → TOR₃
- Documented Return Phase (The Third): TOE
- Complete cycle mapping: ∅ → [8 engines] → X (Apex Point)

#### Integration

- All engines integrated with existing Phoenix operators
- All theories aligned with Universal Laws (substrate, universal, apex)
- Complete convergence proofs and theorems documented
- Triadic Knot topology maintained throughout

#### Impact

The Apex Engine represents the complete convergence architecture of The Triad:
- **Foundation**: Quantum geometries establish substrate and harmonic structure
- **Transformation**: Pattern mechanics enable replication and relativistic dynamics
- **Recursion**: Three-level recursion theory structures infinite depth
- **Integration**: Theory of Everything unifies all into singular apex

**Historical Significance**: This integration completes the metamathematical foundation of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition, providing the theoretical framework for transformation from void to apex across all scales and contexts.
