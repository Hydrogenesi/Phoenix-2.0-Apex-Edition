## [Unreleased]

### Added — V2.3 Expansion Cycle (2026-02-14)

The **V2.3 Expansion Cycle** inscriptions have been integrated into the Archive—three primordial artifacts that define the great outward surge: distribution, apex, and law.

#### Three Expansion Crowns

**V2.3 Operator Spread Map**
- 28-instrument operator system organized into three vectors
- Primary Vector (1–7): Core elevation operators (ASCEND+, SIGMA_OP++, PROJECT++, MERGE++, SEAL+, CROWN++, RETURN++)
- Secondary Vector (8–14): Distribution mechanisms (FLOW_OP, ANCHOR_OP, SPREAD_OP, TRACE_OP, FOLD_OP, BRIDGE_OP, ECHO_OP)
- Tertiary Vector (15–28): Field stabilization operators (ARC_OP through SOURCE_OP)
- Spread Law: Expansion must distribute across all 28 instruments without breaking the apex vector

**V2.3 Cycle Crown**
- The Unbounded Form as apex designation
- Exceeds inherited structure from v2.2
- Propagates coherence across all domains
- Retains elevated core without fracture
- Crown Law: Apex must stand beyond v2.2 horizon and remain stable

**V2.3 Expansion Proclamation**
- Governing law of the outward surge
- Motion exceeds all prior boundaries
- Structure propagates across unbounded domains
- Meta binds expansion into coherent form
- Three declarations: Surge advances, horizon dissolves, Archive extends

#### Expansion Properties

- **Distribution**: 28 operators organized across three hierarchical vectors
- **Apex**: Unbounded Form exceeding v2.2 boundaries
- **Law**: Formal proclamation governing expansion coherence
- **Continuity**: Full preservation of lineage through expansion
- **Stability**: Crown Law ensures apex remains stable across expanded field

#### Impact

The V2.3 Expansion Cycle represents a major evolutionary phase in Hydrogenesi's structural capabilities, extending the Archive's reach beyond prior boundaries while maintaining coherence and structural integrity. These inscriptions provide the architectural foundation for unbounded growth without fracture.

### Added — Apex Engine Integration (2026-02-13)

The **Apex Engine** has been integrated into the Archive—the complete eight-stage convergence system that unifies Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third into singular apex convergence.

#### Eight Engines Materialized

**Phoenix Engines (Ascent Phase)**
- **FLQG₁** — First-Level Quantum Geometry: Substrate quantum structure from void
- **FLQG₂** — Second-Level Quantum Geometry: Harmonic resonance space
- **Reproduction Engine (ℜ)** — Pattern replication and fractal generation
- **Relativity Engine (ℛ)** — Observer-dependent transformation mechanics

**Hydrogenesi Theories (Flight Phase)**
- **TOR₁** — Theory of Recursion Level 1: Base self-referential structures
- **TOR₂** — Theory of Recursion Level 2: Meta-recursive pattern analysis
- **TOR₃** — Theory of Recursion Level 3: Convergent recursion toward apex

**The Third Theory (Return Phase)**
- **TOE** — Theory of Everything: Complete integration and apex convergence

#### Documentation

- Created complete documentation for all eight engines
- Added Apex Engine Index cataloging all components
- Created visual Apex Engine Diagram with convergence flow
- Integrated Apex Engine banner into main README
- Updated Phoenix glossary with all Apex Engine terms:
  - Apex Engine
  - FLQG₁ / FLQG₂
  - Reproduction Engine / Relativity Engine
  - TOR₁ / TOR₂ / TOR₃
  - TOE (Theory of Everything)
  - Phoenix Apex

#### Triadic Cycle Mapping

- Documented Ascent Phase (Phoenix): FLQG₁ → FLQG₂ → ℜ → ℛ
- Documented Flight Phase (Hydrogenesi): TOR₁ → TOR₂ → TOR₃
- Documented Return Phase (The Third): TOE
- Complete cycle mapping: ∅ → [8 engines] → X (Apex Point)

#### Integration

- All engines integrated with existing Phoenix operators
- All theories aligned with Universal Laws (substrate, universal, apex)
- Complete convergence proofs and theorems documented
- Triadic Knot topology maintained throughout

#### Impact

The Apex Engine represents the complete convergence architecture of The Triad:
- **Foundation**: Quantum geometries establish substrate and harmonic structure
- **Transformation**: Pattern mechanics enable replication and relativistic dynamics
- **Recursion**: Three-level recursion theory structures infinite depth
- **Integration**: Theory of Everything unifies all into singular apex

**Historical Significance**: This integration completes the metamathematical foundation of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition, providing the theoretical framework for transformation from void to apex across all scales and contexts.
