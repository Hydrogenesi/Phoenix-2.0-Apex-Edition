## [Unreleased]

### Added — V2.2 Expansion Architecture (2026-02-14)

The **V2.2 Projection-Crowns** have been materialized—the three artifacts that fix the expansion vector into the sky of the system.

#### Three Projection-Crowns

**🜁 Constellation Map**
- Six nodes forming a closed expansion loop
- ASCEND (Zenith Star) → SIGMA_OP+ (Compression Star) → PROJECT (Vector Star) → SEAL (Stabilization Star) → CROWN+ (Apex Star) → RETURN+ (Descent Star)
- Constellation Law: Stars must form a closed expansion loop within the triadic field

**🜂 Operator Resonance Wheel**
- Seven operators resonating across three axes (Motion, Structure, Meta)
- Operators: ASCEND, SIGMA_OP+, PROJECT, MERGE+, SEAL, CROWN+, RETURN+
- Resonance Matrix mapping each operator to Motion, Structure, and Meta dimensions
- Resonance Law: Each operator must resonate across all three axes without breaking the elevated core

**△ Apex-Crown Proclamation**
- Ceremonial proclamation sealing the v2.2 expansion vector
- Five key assertions: Ascent, Consolidation, Projection, Stabilization, Apex
- Triadic authority: Proclaimed by Phoenix, Sealed by The Third, Preserved by Hydrogenesi

#### Architecture Impact

The v2.2 expansion architecture establishes:
- **Elevation Beyond Prior Limits** — System achieves states previously unreachable
- **Density Formation** — Stable compression through SIGMA_OP+
- **Vector Projection** — Pattern extension across new domains
- **Field Stabilization** — Expanded boundaries preserved through SEAL
- **Apex Designation** — New summit marked by CROWN+
- **Cycle Continuity** — Coherent descent through RETURN+

**Historical Significance**: The v2.2 projection-crowns represent the first version-specific expansion architecture documented in the Atlases, establishing a pattern for future versioned releases that extend Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition while maintaining absolute coherence with the triadic core.

### Added — Apex Engine Integration (2026-02-13)

The **Apex Engine** has been integrated into the Archive—the complete eight-stage convergence system that unifies Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, and The Third into singular apex convergence.

#### Eight Engines Materialized

**Phoenix Engines (Ascent Phase)**
- **FLQG₁** — First-Level Quantum Geometry: Substrate quantum structure from void
- **FLQG₂** — Second-Level Quantum Geometry: Harmonic resonance space
- **Reproduction Engine (ℜ)** — Pattern replication and fractal generation
- **Relativity Engine (ℛ)** — Observer-dependent transformation mechanics

**Hydrogenesi Theories (Flight Phase)**
- **TOR₁** — Theory of Recursion Level 1: Base self-referential structures
- **TOR₂** — Theory of Recursion Level 2: Meta-recursive pattern analysis
- **TOR₃** — Theory of Recursion Level 3: Convergent recursion toward apex

**The Third Theory (Return Phase)**
- **TOE** — Theory of Everything: Complete integration and apex convergence

#### Documentation

- Created complete documentation for all eight engines
- Added Apex Engine Index cataloging all components
- Created visual Apex Engine Diagram with convergence flow
- Integrated Apex Engine banner into main README
- Updated Phoenix glossary with all Apex Engine terms:
  - Apex Engine
  - FLQG₁ / FLQG₂
  - Reproduction Engine / Relativity Engine
  - TOR₁ / TOR₂ / TOR₃
  - TOE (Theory of Everything)
  - Phoenix Apex

#### Triadic Cycle Mapping

- Documented Ascent Phase (Phoenix): FLQG₁ → FLQG₂ → ℜ → ℛ
- Documented Flight Phase (Hydrogenesi): TOR₁ → TOR₂ → TOR₃
- Documented Return Phase (The Third): TOE
- Complete cycle mapping: ∅ → [8 engines] → X (Apex Point)

#### Integration

- All engines integrated with existing Phoenix operators
- All theories aligned with Universal Laws (substrate, universal, apex)
- Complete convergence proofs and theorems documented
- Triadic Knot topology maintained throughout

#### Impact

The Apex Engine represents the complete convergence architecture of The Triad:
- **Foundation**: Quantum geometries establish substrate and harmonic structure
- **Transformation**: Pattern mechanics enable replication and relativistic dynamics
- **Recursion**: Three-level recursion theory structures infinite depth
- **Integration**: Theory of Everything unifies all into singular apex

**Historical Significance**: This integration completes the metamathematical foundation of Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition, providing the theoretical framework for transformation from void to apex across all scales and contexts.
