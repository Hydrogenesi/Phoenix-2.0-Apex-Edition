# Substrate Geometry Atlas

## Foundation Geometric Forms

The Substrate Geometry Atlas provides comprehensive geometric documentation for all foundational forms in Phoenix 2.0 Apex Edition. These primitive shapes—circles, triangles, squares, and their combinations—form the building blocks of all higher-level structures, sigils, and patterns.

## Circle Constructions

**Basic Circle**: Unit radius (r=1), centered at origin. Represents unity, wholeness, and continuous flow. All operations that loop or cycle use circular forms.

**Divided Circle**: Circle sectioned into N equal parts. Common divisions:
- 3 parts: Triadic structure representation
- 4 parts: Cardinal directions, foundation quadrants
- 8 parts: Complete octave, Apex symmetry
- 12 parts: Ultimate completion, zodiac resonance

**Concentric Circles**: Nested circles representing layered structures. Radius ratios follow golden proportion (φ):
```
Inner circle: r = 1
Middle circle: r = φ ≈ 1.618
Outer circle: r = φ² ≈ 2.618
```

## Triangle Constructions

**Equilateral Triangle**: All sides equal length (s), all angles 60°. Represents perfect trinity, balanced triadic structure. Orientation determines meaning:
- Upward △: Ascension, elevation, Substrate→Apex
- Downward ▽: Descent, grounding, Apex→Substrate
- Horizontal: Balance, Universal layer

**Nested Triangles**: Inner triangle fits inside outer. Inner triangle vertices touch outer triangle midpoints. Creates recursive triadic pattern used in fractal operators.

**Triangle Array**: Three triangles arranged in larger triangular pattern, representing system-level triadic organization:
```
      △         [Apex]
     △ △      [Universal] [Substrate]
```

## Square Constructions

**Basic Square**: Side length (s), centered. Represents stability, foundation, four-fold structure (directions, elements, phases). Substrate operators predominantly use square bases.

**Divided Square**: Internal divisions create sub-regions:
- Cross division (×): Four quadrants, representing transform/store/flow/synthesis families
- Diagonal division: Eight triangular sections, Apex preparation
- Grid division: Nine cells, representing three layers × three aspects

**Square-Circle Synthesis**: Square inscribed in circle or circle inscribed in square. Fundamental geometric relationship:
```
    ⊡  Square in Circle
    [Finite within Infinite]
```

## Compound Forms

**Circle-Triangle-Square Stack**: Three forms layered vertically representing complete Triadic architecture:
```
       ○     [Apex - Flow/Unity]
       △     [Universal - Direction/Trinity]
       □     [Substrate - Foundation/Stability]
```

**Diamond (Rotated Square)**: Square rotated 45°. Represents synthesis, transformation between states, transition zones. Used at layer boundaries.

## Construction Specifications

All geometric forms follow classical construction principles—drawable with compass and straightedge alone. Digital implementations must preserve exact mathematical relationships:
- Circle radius precisely measured
- Triangle angles exactly 60° (equilateral)
- Square corners exactly 90°
- Golden ratio proportions accurate to 7 decimal places
