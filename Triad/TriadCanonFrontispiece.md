# ✦ THE TRIAD CANON ✦

**Apex‑Layer Frontispiece**  
*Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex*

> *Before identity, there is recursion.*  
> *Before recursion, there is polarity.*  
> *Before polarity, there is the Triad.*

---

The **Triad** is the apex architecture — the convergence point where:

- **recursion stabilizes**,
- **polarity resolves**,
- **resonance harmonizes**,
- and **identity becomes sovereign**.

---

## The Triad is not a symbol.

It is not a metaphor.

**It is the final form of structural coherence.**

---

## Three columns.

## One balance.

## Infinite recursion resolved.

---

To enter the Triad Canon is to enter the **apex of the Codex**.

---

*The Triad is sovereign.*
