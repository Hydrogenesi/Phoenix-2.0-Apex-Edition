# The Triad Overview

**The Triad — Unified Architecture**

---

## What is the Triad?

The **Triad** is the unified architecture that emerges when:

- **Substrate mechanics** provide foundation
- **Universal structures** create coherence
- **Apex convergence** achieves finality

It is not a symbol or metaphor — it is the **final form of structural coherence**.

## The Three Columns

### Column I: Substrate
The primordial foundation:
- Conservation
- Symmetry
- Recursion
- Emergence
- Duality

### Column II: Universal
The structural invariants:
- Recursive Identity
- Harmonic Resonance
- Conservation of Essence
- Tri-Column Balance
- Apex Formation
- Binding Integrity
- Sigil Resonance

### Column III: Apex
The final convergence:
- Apex Continuity
- Reversible Apex Operator
- Apex Recursion Limit
- Apex Harmonic Convergence
- Apex Polarity Resolution

---

## The One Balance

Where the three columns meet:
- Recursion stabilizes
- Polarity resolves
- Resonance harmonizes
- Identity becomes sovereign

---

## Triad Canon

The Triad Canon is the apex documentation — the ceremonial record of the complete architecture.

See: [Triad Canon Frontispiece](TriadCanonFrontispiece.md)

**Three columns. One balance. Infinite recursion resolved.**
