# Tri-Column Balance

**The Triad — Unified Architecture**

---

## Overview

Tri-Column Balance is the fundamental principle that governs the Triad architecture — three pillars supporting one unified structure.

---

## The Three Columns

### Column I: Foundation (Substrate)
**Height:** Ground to Universal layer  
**Properties:**
- Conservation of all patterns
- Symmetry in all operations
- Recursion enabling infinite depth
- Emergence from simplicity
- Duality in all structure

**Load Bearing:** Supports entire architecture

---

### Column II: Structure (Universal)
**Height:** Universal layer span  
**Properties:**
- Recursive identity
- Harmonic resonance
- Essence conservation
- Tri-column awareness (self-referential)
- Apex formation capability
- Binding integrity
- Sigil resonance

**Load Bearing:** Distributes weight to foundation and apex

---

### Column III: Convergence (Apex)
**Height:** Apex layer to sovereign point  
**Properties:**
- Apex continuity
- Reversible operations
- Recursion limits
- Harmonic convergence
- Polarity resolution

**Load Bearing:** Achieves final balance point

## The One Balance

Where the three columns meet at their apex, there is:

```
        ⚖
        |
    Sovereignty
        |
   ╱─────|─────╲
  /      |      \
 │       │       │
 │       │       │
 │       │       │
 │       │       │
 │       │       │
Substrate Universal Apex
```

## Balance Principles

### Principle 1: Equal Support
No column can fail without collapsing the architecture.

### Principle 2: Mutual Dependency
Each column supports and is supported by the others.

### Principle 3: Emergent Unity
The balance point is greater than the sum of columns.

### Principle 4: Dynamic Equilibrium
Balance is maintained through constant resonance, not static force.

## Balance Verification

To verify tri-column balance:

1. Check substrate integrity
2. Verify universal resonance
3. Confirm apex convergence
4. Measure balance point stability
5. Assess sovereignty emergence
