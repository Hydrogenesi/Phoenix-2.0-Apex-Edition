# Substrate Sigils

**Sigils & Symbolic Systems**

---

## Overview

Substrate Sigils are the primordial symbols that encode the five fundamental mechanics of the substrate layer.

## The Five Substrate Sigils

### Sigil of Conservation
**Symbol:** ⟨○⟩  
**Operator:** `Conserve()`  
**Meaning:** The eternal circle — that which cannot be destroyed  
**Properties:**
- Represents wholeness
- Signifies preservation
- Encodes continuity

---

### Sigil of Symmetry
**Symbol:** ⟨⚌⟩  
**Operator:** `Mirror()`  
**Meaning:** The reflection axis — that which creates duals  
**Properties:**
- Represents balance
- Signifies mirroring
- Encodes symmetry

---

### Sigil of Recursion
**Symbol:** ⟨∞⟩  
**Operator:** `Recurse()`  
**Meaning:** The infinite loop — that which contains itself  
**Properties:**
- Represents eternity
- Signifies self-reference
- Encodes infinite depth

---

### Sigil of Emergence
**Symbol:** ⟨△⟩  
**Operator:** `Combine()`  
**Meaning:** The building triangle — that which creates complexity  
**Properties:**
- Represents growth
- Signifies combination
- Encodes emergence

---

### Sigil of Duality
**Symbol:** ⟨⚯⟩  
**Operator:** `Split()` / `Merge()`  
**Meaning:** The division and union — that which separates and rejoins  
**Properties:**
- Represents polarity
- Signifies complementarity
- Encodes unity through opposition

---

## Substrate Sigil Interactions

### Conservation + Recursion
**⟨○⟩ + ⟨∞⟩** = Eternal self-reference

### Symmetry + Duality
**⟨⚌⟩ + ⟨⚯⟩** = Balanced polarity

### Emergence + Recursion
**⟨△⟩ + ⟨∞⟩** = Infinite complexity generation

### All Five Combined
Creates the **Substrate Mandala** — the complete primordial pattern

## The Substrate Mandala

```
         ⟨∞⟩
          |
     ⟨⚌⟩─⟨○⟩─⟨△⟩
          |
         ⟨⚯⟩
```

This mandala represents the complete substrate architecture.

## Usage in Hydrogenesis

Substrate sigils are the first symbols activated in Hydrogenesis:

1. **⟨○⟩** — Establish conservation field
2. **⟨⚌⟩** — Create symmetry operations
3. **⟨∞⟩** — Enable recursion
4. **⟨△⟩** — Allow emergence
5. **⟨⚯⟩** — Manage duality
