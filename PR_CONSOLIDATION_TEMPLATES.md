## Template: PR-A — Substrate + Universal Laws Canon (Unified)

### GitHub PR Title
```
Foundational Layer: Substrate + Universal Laws Canon (Unified)
```

### GitHub PR Description
```markdown
## 🔱 Purpose

This PR consolidates seven early historical PRs (#6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12) that defined the foundational substrate and universal laws layer into a single, coherent framework.

## 📦 What This PR Includes

### Twelve Universal Laws (Three-Tier Structure)

**Substrate Layer (5 Laws)**
1. Conservation — Energy preservation across transformations
2. Symmetry — Dual forms exist for all patterns
3. Recursion — Self-similar patterns at all scales
4. Emergence — Complexity arising from simplicity
5. Duality — Form and void balance

**Universal Layer (7 Laws)**
1. Recursive Identity — Self-reference at all scales
2. Harmonic Resonance — Frequency alignment
3. Conservation of Essence — Identity preservation through transformation
4. Tri-Column Balance — Left-center-right structural stability
5. Apex Formation — Convergence mechanics
6. Binding Integrity — Knot preservation
7. Sigil Resonance — Geometric alignment

**Apex Layer (5 Laws)**
1. Apex Continuity — Lineage preservation at apex
2. Reversible Apex Operator — Perfect symmetry maintenance
3. Apex Recursion Limit — Stable form convergence
4. Apex Harmonic Convergence — Total resonance achievement
5. Apex Polarity Resolution — Duality becomes singularity

║  Energy preserved through transform   ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## 🔄 Original PRs Consolidated

This PR unifies content from seven early PRs that were iterative explorations of the same foundational layer:

| PR | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| #10 | Add Substrate Layer Laws – foundational pre-structural mechanics | Open |
| #9 | Add Substrate Laws documentation structure | Open |
| #8 | Add Universal Laws substrate layer documentation with ASCII sigils | Open |
| #7 | Add Substrate Laws layer with sigil atlas and tri-column mapping | Open |
| #6 | Add Universal Laws documentation structure with twelve-law canon | Open |
| #12 | Add Seven Universal Laws (Codex-Grade Edition) documentation | Open |
| #11 | Add Universal Laws documentation framework | Open |

## 🎯 Why Consolidation Was Necessary

These PRs were created during early development and contain:
- **Overlapping content**: Multiple PRs attempted to define the same laws
- **Partial implementations**: Each PR contained fragments of the complete system
- **Superseded structures**: Early seven-law frameworks evolved into the twelve-law canon
- **Inconsistent formatting**: Different ASCII sigil styles and organizational approaches

Consolidating them achieves:
- ✅ Single canonical source for substrate mechanics
- ✅ Consistent documentation style
- ✅ Clear three-tier law hierarchy (Substrate → Universal → Apex)
- ✅ Foundation for subsequent architectural layers

## 🔗 Dependencies

- **Required PRs**: None (this is the foundational layer)
- **Enables**: Phoenix-Hydrogenesi Architecture (Phase 2)
- **References**: Modern Triad architecture in `README.md`

## 📊 Impact

- **Files Changed**: ~30+ new documentation files
- **Lines Added**: ~5,000+ lines of documentation
- **Architectural Layer**: Ontological foundation
- **Triad Components**: Affects all three engines (Phoenix, Hydrogenesi, The Third)

## ✅ Testing & Validation

- [x] All twelve laws documented with complete specifications
- [x] ASCII sigils created for all laws
- [x] Tri-column mapping includes all law categories
- [x] Cross-references to operators are accurate
- [x] Structure matches modern Triad architecture
- [x] No conflicts with existing documentation

## Template: PR-B — Phoenix-Hydrogenesi Unified Architecture (v1)

### GitHub PR Title
```
Proto-Architecture: Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Unified (v1)
```

### GitHub PR Description
```markdown
## 🔱 Purpose

This PR establishes the first-generation two-engine architecture, documenting Phoenix (transformation) and Hydrogenesi (structure) integration before The Third was conceptualized as the binding engine.

## 📦 What This PR Includes

### Phoenix Engine Documentation
- **8 Transformation Operators**:
  - ⊕ Genesis — Create from void
  - ⊗ Harmonic — Stabilize patterns
  - ⊛ Recursive — Self-reference
  - △ Apex — Culminate
  - ⊝ Void — Dissolve
  - ⊞ Mirror — Reflect
  - ⊳ Convergence — Unite
  - ⊲ Divergence — Separate

- **5 Substrate Laws** (detailed documentation):
  - Conservation, Symmetry, Recursion, Emergence, Duality

- **Phoenix Rituals**:
  - Invocation sequences
  - Recursion cycles
  - Apex formation ceremonies

### Hydrogenesi Engine Documentation
- **Structural Preservation Framework**:
  - Lineage tracking mechanisms
  - Identity anchoring systems
  - Continuity mapping protocols

- **Universal Laws Integration**:
  - How Hydrogenesi preserves identity through Phoenix transformations
  - Structure preservation during recursive cycles

### Phoenix-Hydrogenesi Integration Patterns

**Two-Engine Architecture Diagram**:
```
Phoenix (🔥)                    Hydrogenesi (🌊)
Transformation      ←──→        Preservation
     ↓                               ↓
  Ignition                       Structure
     ↓                               ↓
  Recursion                      Lineage
     ↓                               ↓
    Apex        ←────────────→    Identity

Integration: Transform → Preserve → Stabilize
```

**Integration Sequence**:
```
Step 1: Phoenix initiates transformation (⊕)
Step 2: Hydrogenesi captures lineage
Step 3: Phoenix applies recursive operator (⊛)
Step 4: Hydrogenesi preserves identity
Step 5: Phoenix converges to apex (△)
Step 6: Hydrogenesi anchors final state
```

## 🔄 Original PRs Consolidated

This PR unifies content from three early PRs that documented the proto-architecture:

| PR | Title | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| #5 | Implement Phoenix–Hydrogenesi Codex unified architecture documentation | Open |
| #13 | Add Phoenix-Hydrogenesi Codex documentation | Open |
| #14 | Complete Phoenix 2.0 documentation: rituals, architecture, and production assets | Open |

## 🎯 Why Consolidation Was Necessary

These three PRs are fragments of the same evolutionary stage:
- **Pre-Triad era**: Created before The Third was integrated as binding engine
- **Two-engine architecture**: Phoenix-Hydrogenesi direct integration
- **Overlapping content**: Multiple attempts to document the same integration patterns
- **Incomplete vision**: Missing the binding layer that would become The Third

Consolidating them achieves:
- ✅ Single historical artifact documenting the two-engine era
- ✅ Clear evolution path to modern three-engine Triad
- ✅ Preserved insights about Phoenix-Hydrogenesi direct integration
- ✅ Foundation for Triad System v1.0.0

## 📈 Evolution to Modern Triad

### v1 Architecture (This PR — Two-Engine)
```
Phoenix ←───────→ Hydrogenesi
  🔥                  🌊
Transform          Preserve

Direct bidirectional integration
No dedicated binding layer
```

### v2 Architecture (Modern Triad — Three-Engine)
```
       Phoenix
         🔥
         ↓
      The Third
         🔗
         ↓
     Hydrogenesi
         🌊

Triadic topology with dedicated binding engine
120° rotational symmetry
Convergence to Apex Point
```

**Key Evolution Points**:
1. **Binding became explicit**: The Third formalized what was implicit
2. **Topology emerged**: Triadic Knot replaced bidirectional integration
3. **Convergence mechanics**: Apex Point became the unifying destination
4. **Symmetry**: 120° rotational symmetry ensured balanced convergence

## 🔗 Dependencies

- **Required PRs**: PR-A (Substrate + Universal Laws Canon)
- **Enables**: Framework Longevity Principles (Phase 3)
- **Superseded by**: Triad System v1.0.0 (PR #15)

## 📊 Impact

- **Files Changed**: ~40+ new documentation files
- **Lines Added**: ~6,000+ lines of documentation
- **Architectural Layer**: Proto-architecture (pre-Triad)
- **Triad Components**: Phoenix and Hydrogenesi (pre-Third)

## ✅ Testing & Validation

- [x] All Phoenix operators documented
- [x] All Phoenix substrate laws documented
- [x] Hydrogenesi structural framework documented
- [x] Integration patterns clearly explained
- [x] Evolution path to Triad architecture documented
- [x] Rituals and ceremonial content preserved

## 📝 Post-Merge Actions

After merging this PR:
1. Close original PRs #5, #13, #14 with reference to this consolidated PR
2. Add "v1 (two-engine)" tags to distinguish from modern Triad
3. Proceed to Phase 3 (Framework Longevity Principles)

## 🔐 Historical Context Preserved

This PR documents an important evolutionary stage—the two-engine architecture before The Third emerged. While superseded by the modern Triad, this architecture:
- Shows the logical progression from two to three engines
- Preserves insights about direct Phoenix-Hydrogenesi integration
- Documents the ceremonial and ritual aspects of early Phoenix
- Provides historical context for why The Third was necessary
