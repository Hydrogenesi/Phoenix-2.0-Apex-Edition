# Phoenix Archive — Hydrogenesi Framework
## A Scale-Invariant Cosmological Framework

> *Two measurements. One scale factor. The solar system falls out.*

## The Finding

Moon radius / Proton radius = 2.044 x 10^21

Apply this single scale factor to the hydrogen atom ground state:

    n=1 Bohr radius x scale factor = 0.7240 AU
    Venus actual orbit             = 0.7230 AU
    Delta                          = 0.14%

Venus sits at the hydrogen atom ground state, scaled to solar system size.
No fitting. No adjustment. The measurement was always there.

## The Earth Correction

Two gravitational waves from the binary solar split produce a correction of sqrt(2):

    n=1 x scale factor x sqrt(2) = 1.0239 AU
    Earth actual orbit            = 1.0000 AU
    Delta                         = 2.39%

Life emerged exactly where the binary split physics placed it.

## The Numbers

Scale factor:          2.044e21  (moon radius / proton radius)
Venus match:           0.14%
Earth match:           2.39%
Planck to Universe:    2.723e61
Universe as nucleus:   2.9e15 light years

## Framework

First Law: centrifugal force pushes heavy elements outward in any spinning body.
No core can be iron. All cores under sufficient pressure are metallic hydrogen.

Scale Invariance: one geometry, one path, every scale simultaneously.
Hydrogen atom -> solar system -> galaxy -> universe. Same forces. Same geometry.

The Living Atom: our solar system is a living hydrogen atom.
Sun = nucleus. Planets = electron cloud. Belts = shell boundaries.

The One Path: molecular cloud -> protostar -> T Tauri gate -> main sequence
-> metallicized apex -> pole gathering -> AGN convergence -> apex

Three paths to apex: Life -> AGN, Light -> elliptical galaxy, End plight -> field

Cycle of Apex: apex feeds infinity. Infinity folds again. No beginning. No end.
